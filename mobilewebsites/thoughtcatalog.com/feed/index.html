<p><strong>1</strong>. &#8220;We were both super drunk. We woke up the next morning and were like &#8216;Oh no, what did we do?&#8217; Obviously we both knew what went down, but I think we both just saw it as a drunken moment of desperation and loneliness. Our friendship still stands.&#8221; <strong>—Keith, 25</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always thought he was super attractive, but didn&#8217;t see him in that way. One night we were watching a movie at my place with Chinese takeout, extremely casual, and for some reason I just wanted to see what it was like to kiss him, maybe to assure myself that I had no feelings for him and just thought he was hot. I was right, no feelings, and the kiss definitely helped me find out. It was only weird for the rest of the night, we&#8217;re still friends today.&#8221; <strong>—Annie, 24</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. &#8220;Hate to admit it, but I&#8217;ve had a thing for her from the very beginning. She&#8217;s perfect, which is exactly why we&#8217;re such close friends, and I guess my hopes for more lead me to make the move. She didn&#8217;t back away, which was a huge relief, but I don&#8217;t think she exactly enjoyed it either because it never happened again. She said she didn&#8217;t want to risk our friendship, just another way of saying, &#8216;I&#8217;m not into you like that,&#8217; but no hard feelings, she&#8217;s still one of the coolest girls I know.&#8221; <strong>—Richie, 25</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>4</strong>. &#8220;She identifies as lesbian, and hooks up with girls, but the one night she totally came onto me. I don&#8217;t know what made her do it, and if she even had a good time, and when we talked about it she told me she&#8217;s definitely gay, so I guess she was just curious. I was cool with it and so was she, it was just a little weird moment that happened, no big deal.&#8221; <strong>—Kyle, 24</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. &#8220;We were friends for all of college, so four years. I thought there was underlying chemistry there, obviously because we got along so well as friends, and when we tested it out, I think I got more attached than I had planned. We hooked up multiple times, and I guess I just wanted a little more respect than to be just a hookup. He wasn&#8217;t willing to give that to me, and we haven&#8217;t talked since.&#8221; <strong>—Kelly, 23</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>6</strong>. &#8220;On senior week, he let me share his bed, and he did a little more than share it. We both blamed it on being drunk, so it was sort of overlooked and forgotten. Basically it was like it never even happened.&#8221; <strong>—Chloe, 23</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>7</strong>. &#8220;There was always a little bit of sexual tension there, just because we were such good friends and with each other every weekend. Finally I put the idea out there that we should just try hooking up. Damn I was wrong. The next few times seeing each other were extremely weird. You could tell we changed how we were around each other. Luckily we talked about it and got over it, and now laugh about it. It&#8217;s something that would never happen again with us. We are just meant to be close friends.&#8221; <strong>—Jim, 24</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>8</strong>. &#8220;Yeah, that happened. We&#8217;re still friends, but I think it&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t talked about it to this day. I think that&#8217;s best for both of us.&#8221; <strong>—Drew, 24</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>9</strong>. &#8220;He had just broken up with his girlfriend, and of course I was there for support. He kept going on and on about how hard it was, and how much he&#8217;d miss her. If I&#8217;m being honest, I was the one who made the first move. I think maybe I felt bad for him, and wanted him to feel better. I actually don&#8217;t really know what I was thinking, but we&#8217;re still friends. I think he just sees it as a moment of weakness.&#8221; <strong>—Victoria, 24</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>10</strong>. &#8220;She&#8217;s awesome, but she&#8217;s basically like one of the guys. She&#8217;d probably kill me if she knew I said that, but I mean it as a compliment. I think I hooked up with her because we&#8217;re around each other so much that it almost felt like we were dating. Hooking up with her made me realize we are not a couple, which I guess is a good thing. Ever since we did it though something has been different between us. It sucks, but that&#8217;s just the way it is, and I don&#8217;t think talking about it will do anything.&#8221; <strong>—Nick, 25</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/beetlejuice3.jpg?w=500&#038;h=4" alt="beetlejuice" width="500" height="4" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472991" /></p>
<p><strong>11</strong>. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t had sex in like 4 months, and from what I knew she hadn&#8217;t had sex in a while either. It was weird, but at least we got it out of our system. She knows I was just super horny, and it&#8217;s cool that she didn&#8217;t make it a huge deal. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m friends with her, no drama ever.&#8221; <strong>—Chris, 25 <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535689&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure data-id="535657" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1140px;"><img class="size-large wp-image-535657" src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/0du466l58g.jpg?w=1140&#038;h=758" alt="Stocksnap.io / Ondrej Supitar" width="1140" height="758" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/0DU466L58G" target="_blank" target="_blank">Stocksnap.io / Ondrej Supitar</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>On my list of favorite things to do, going to the dentist for a check up oddly doesn’t make an appearance. If it ranks on yours, I’d recommend taking a pen and stabbing it into your hand to ensure you’re not actually a cyborg. If you’re a cyborg, power down and leave us alone. If you’re not a cyborg, I’m sorry about your hand, but you deserved it.</p>
<p>The reason I hate the dentist actually doesn’t have anything to do with the drilling or smells or that awkward moment when you’re gagging on your own saliva because the dental assistant has the vacuum thing in the wrong place and you try to swallow with your mouth open. I mean, I don’t like those things either, but those pale in comparison to the root of my anxiety. It’s actually simple: I hate the anticipation of finding out if I have cavities.</p>
<p>In my misguided past, I chose to avoid that problem by avoiding the dentist — brilliant! I’m more responsible now and average a check up every 6… 10-ish months. But that doesn’t change the pit I feel in my stomach while I sit in the waiting room reading 7-year-old Highlights magazines or while I wear that chic metal x-ray gown or while the dentist pores over the x-rays, letting out ambiguous “Hrmm”s and “Okay”s while I await the verdict. I feel my palms sweating when the dentist asks, “Are you flossing regularly?” But what does “regularly” even mean, right? So I answer yes. And thankfully, despite my not-so-honest response, I’ve had a clean bill of dental health the last two go-arounds.</p>
<p>After my visit, I feel euphoric. My teeth are sparkly, healthy, and I feel like I’ve just received a new lease on life. Even when there is bad news, I still feel relieved. I faced the beast straight in the eyes, weathered the news, and survived to tell about it. And you better believe I floss every day after the visit. For at least a week.</p>
<p>Where am I going with this? Here’s where I’m going with this. I think a lot of us feel that same anxiety as it relates to our finances. For that very reason, we avoid checking our bank accounts. Or we keep a tab open for months about how to debt snowball, because that basically counts as “doing it.” Or we choose to ignore “what ifs” and spend for today, ignoring tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is our wake up call. This is our chance to answer (truthfully) “do you floss” — except you’re the patient AND the dentist and you’ll know if you’re lying. So let’s face our demons and get this financial gut check over with.</p>
<p>Answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I know how much my net worth increased/decreased last month?</li>
<li>Am I cheating my future self on retirement savings?</li>
<li>If I lost my job tomorrow, how panicked would I feel?</li>
<li>Are my last 10 expenses congruent with my budget?</li>
<li>Am I more concerned with <em>looking</em> “well off” than <em>being</em> “well off”?</li>
<li>When was the last time I saved money I didn’t have to save?</li>
<li>What would I do if my car broke down?</li>
<li>Am I insured against the things that would ruin me financially?</li>
<li>If I met my soulmate tomorrow, how would I feel about turning over my Mint.com password?</li>
<li>What are my financial habits teaching my kids?</li>
</ol>
<p>Is sweat dripping off your mouse? Some of those were hard for me to type. It’s weird writing questions you know you don’t want to answer. But we’re all better off for addressing the good, bad, and ugly.</p>
<p>Pat yourself on the back for the questions you feel confident about, crack your knuckles and roll up your sleeves for the ones you know could use some work, and schedule a text to auto-send to yourself every single day with the question(s) that made you feel icky. This is your intervention, peeps. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535636&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure data-id="535721" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1140px;"><img class="size-large wp-image-535721" src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/photo-1444837870946-e65ae2ef054e.jpg?w=1140&#038;h=760" alt="Unsplash / Nathan Walker" width="1140" height="760" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/S-PyX-IVPfA" target="_blank">Unsplash / Nathan Walker</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Love, if not shared, one cannot call love. Call it the memory of love or the longing for love. Or even better, obsession. It happened to all of us, no matter how cool, intelligent and loveable we think we are.</p>
<p>Is unrequited love, the dramatic, intense and eventually painful type of love, just an obsession? I kept thinking about this lately.</p>
<p>I remember a talk I had many years ago with a guy I loved for a little while and became obsessed with for a longer while. I was very young back then, but as idealist as I am today. How long after we break up with someone should we have that person in mind? What&#8217;s the purpose of thinking about a person all over again?</p>
<p>We were colleagues at the university and had a brief love affair in the first year. After we broke up, I kept thinking about him. It was hard not to do so since our paths crossed on a daily basis. I kept looking for signs of his feelings towards me in everything he did, in his gestures, in his words, in his overall behaviour. I was experiencing an outburst of imagination, which I translated into poetry. My frantic mental activity required a person to share my full palette of emotions with. And this is what friends are for. I had a best friend as a confident. Someone to trust and feel at ease with when talking about love. Or obsession.</p>
<p>I think about love all the time. For artists, love equals inspiration. I find myself writing nostalgic texts when I need to release some pressure from my heart. I always tend to go back to the past when I write. With painting, it is different because if I let my hand go free, I can discover some unknown things. Writing can be painful, it fixes the weight of the words on a support, but painting is more dreamy. I don&#8217;t care about perspective, technique, quality. If I wanted to obey rules, I wouldn&#8217;t have turned to art. There is something heavy inside myself and something feathery. This is why I paint and write. This is nostalgia.</p>
<p>It was a hot summer day and I was hungover. As I was diving deeper inside my obsession, I started feeling as I was drifting away somewhere in the middle of the sea, with no direction to go. There were times when life seemed meaningless. I was constantly questioning and doubting my path in life. If I have a high capacity of endurance now, it originates in those times. I met him and we went to a park close to my house. I looked at his face, looking for familiar gestures, like those I used to see when I closed my eyes. He had been constantly on my mind for the past two years. But only then, I was to meet the real person that fuelled my imagination. He could have kissed me, he could have grabbed my hand and time could have stopped for a second. There is always a gap between how we want things to be and how they are.</p>
<p>The difference between true love and obsession is reality. Our ability to distinguish between how a person really is and how our imagination wants that person to be is just a matter of psychological exercise. We always tend to give some imaginary traits of character to the persons we love, it is part of the way human interactions work. But only when we manage to break those illusions, we can eventually conclude: it was true love or it was just obsession.</p>
<p>We met on that day and walked a few steps together because I wanted to know how could he be dating my best friend. This is such a common tale, that no one should be surprised about. I was waiting for an answer that never came. And as the man I thought I loved, when I was only obsessed with, started revealing his true self, I could see my distorted image of him breaking into pieces.</p>
<p>The day when he could have grabbed my hand, but he didn&#8217;t, we sat down on a bench and looked at children playing. He told me about my giant ego and how I will see, one day I will get a job and lead a normal life, how this is a temporary adolescent-like crisis and as years fade away, I will remember vaguely about an artistic rebellion against life I once had. The day when he could have honestly told me why he is dating my best friend, he went on chit-chatting about meaningless things, giving unsolicited advice about how to live the best cliché. And nobody stopped to applaud the glorious break of an illusion.</p>
<p>And I understood back then, in that summer day, sitting on a bench in a park next to my house, that he cannot deal with me, that what people call mad is something they do not understand, that overpasses their capacities and that there are people who will try to cut off your wings because they cannot imagine themselves with wings. Years passed by and I did not change that much. I don&#8217;t remember if I called him a coward or I just felt pity for myself. For how love is ultimately a solitary experience, how most of the passions are built on lies we tell to ourselves and how there are wounds that some people create and only other people can heal. But in order to make possible the healing, we need to contribute it to it ourselves.</p>
<p>The guy I was obsessed with and my former best friend are now married. They also have a child.</p>
<p>Why do we need to experience pain and longing for a person, why do we need to have our heads filled with thoughts about someone that is no longer part of our present, as we find ourselves completely alone in our rooms? This case of self erotica, the exploration of oneself through art or whatever the means has ultimately a purpose: to learn love and compassion for ourselves, for the entire being.</p>
<p>Our expectations are made of hope and waiting. Our expectations are those stinging our hearts because pain reminds us we are alive. When we reach a certain level of emotion, we lose the consciousness of our body, we mix up with the air around us. As if to mingle with the air around us is the best type of silence we could have. Hope and waiting are made of silence. But us, humans, we are talkative beings and sometimes we need to kill our old expectations, just to be able to build new ones. As long as we live,we will be looking for people with whom silence disappears. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535713&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>“I want to be wealthy…”<br />
“I want to travel the world and learn more languages…”<br />
“I want to lose 10 lbs. this year.”</em></p>
<p>We’ve all dreamed of these lofty goals in life at one point or another, especially during New Years.</p>
<p>Setting goals is an essential technique to accomplishing what we truly want in our lives, and more importantly—living a more fulfilling life. And the importance of goal setting is only increasing as our ability to focus continues to diminish with the rise of new media and technology.</p>
<div class="tc_pull_quote">“Setting goals in life is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.”—Tony Robbins</div>
<p>If you’re truly committed in achieving your most important goals, whether it’s to learn a new language, lose 10lbs, start your own business, it all starts with this…</p>
<h3>1. Know What You Really Want</h3>
<p>One day, Warren Buffett was having a long conversation with his pilot.</p>
<p>After realizing that his pilot has been working with him for quite some time, Warren decided to perform a goal setting exercise with him.</p>
<p>He first started by asking his pilot to list 25 goals in life he’d like to achieve in the next 5 years.</p>
<div class="tc_pull_quote">“Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work.” —H. L. Hunt</div>
<p><strong>Go nuts</strong></p>
<p>We’re going to borrow Warren’s strategy by starting to list all the possible goals and dreams you have for your life in the next five years.</p>
<p>Go nuts. The bigger the dream, the better. And feel free to list more than 25 if you’re feeling ambitious.</p>
<p><strong>Domino effect</strong></p>
<p>After a few hours, his pilot came back to him with his list of 25 goals he’d like to accomplish.</p>
<p>Then Warren told his pilot to narrow that list down to only 5 goals.</p>
<p>His pilot hesitantly responded, “But these are all important to me… that’s why I wrote them down.” Yet Warren persisted and told him he could only pick 5.</p>
<p>When his pilot returned with his 5 goals, Warren surprised him by responding: “Okay, do you see the 20 goals that you haven’t circled? This is now your ‘avoid-at-all-cost’ list.”</p>
<p>The takeaway lesson from the mindset of this billionaire is: <strong>focus is essential.</strong></p>
<p>It’s better to focus on 5 important goals that we can fully accomplish well, rather than 25 goals we perform mediocrely.</p>
<p>In the book <em>The ONE Thing</em>, the author Gary Keller states that you can ask yourself this simple question to narrow down your goals:</p>
<p><strong>“What is the ONE Thing I can accomplish [from this list], so that if I accomplish it, everything else will become easier or unnecessary.”</strong></p>
<p>Keller refers to this technique as the Domino Effect.</p>
<div class="tc_pull_quote">“If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.”</div>
<p>For example, let’s say your 5-year goal is to make $1,000,000 for your business, and your business has 3 revenue streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product #1: $100,000/yr; growing 10%/mo</li>
<li>Product #2: $100,000/yr; growing 25%/mo</li>
<li>Consulting: $75,000/yr; growing 15%/mo</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of diverting your attention and managing the growth of 3 separate revenue streams, why not focus your resources and energy on one product/service with the highest growth potential (i.e. Product #2), that will make everything else unnecessary to reach your ultimate goal?</p>
<p>This is what the tech icon Steve Jobs did when he cut 70% of Apple’s products in order to focus on the few that mattered, like the Macbook, iPod, and eventually the iPhone.</p>
<p>Or what Jason Fried and his team at 37signals announced last year by deciding to rebrand their company to Basecamp, and drop maintaining their other popular products.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://rypeapp.com/blog/foreign-language/" target="_blank" target="_blank">language learning</a>, let’s say you want to <a href="http://rypeapp.com/blog/study-spanish/" target="_blank" target="_blank">become fluent in Spanish</a> in 6 months and your measurement for success is having a 30-minute conversation with a native speaker.</p>
<p>Instead of diverting your attention to learning everything from reading, writing, and learning from different textbooks &amp; courses, you can maximize your limited time and energy by focusing on learning the most <a href="http://rypeapp.com/blog/dirty-spanish-words/" target="_blank" target="_blank">common Spanish words</a>, and practicing your speaking skills.</p>
<p><strong>Your “Why”</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons why <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/01/01/just-8-of-people-achieve-their-new-years-resolutions-heres-how-they-did-it/" target="_blank" target="_blank">only 8%</a> of people achieve their New Year’s Resolutions is the lack of motivation.</p>
<p>And the reason why we lose motivation in the first place is not having a strong enough “why.”</p>
<p>Discovering our why requires us to dig deeper than the immediate reward of achieving the goal.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself (and write down).</p>
<p>Imagine you accomplished your goal(s):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How will you feel?</strong> Will you feel invincible, overjoyed, powerful, fulfilled, grateful, excited, energetic, healthy, fit, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Who will you be around?</strong> Will you be connecting and have deeper relationships with fellow language lovers across the world? Become associated with influential people you would love to connect with</li>
<li><strong>Who will you become?</strong> Will you be more confident, interesting to you friends and family, reassured, giving, happy, financially independent, polyglot, etc.</li>
<li><strong>What opportunities will this open up?</strong> What doors will open up for you if you achieve this goal? <a href="http://rypeapp.com/blog/travel-the-world/" target="_blank" target="_blank">Travel the world</a>, more speaking opportunities, improve your love life, ability to learn other languages much faster, have a deeper connection with family members, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how much more powerful and motivating this is compared to simply writing down:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Lose 15 lbs.”</li>
<li>“Make $100,000.”</li>
<li>“Learn Spanish.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Model, Model, Model</h3>
<p>Whatever it is that you want to accomplish, chances are that someone else in the world has already done it.</p>
<p><a href="http://rypeapp.com/blog/learning-curve/" target="_blank" target="_blank">Learning to model</a> can be one of the most powerful techniques to achieve any goals in life faster, because you can learn from the mistakes and lesson from those who have come before you.</p>
<p>On a piece of paper, rewrite the 5 goals you have chosen and:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">-Beside each goal write down 3 people that have achieved what you want to achieve. It can be someone you know, met, or an influencer you follow.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">-Reverse-engineer in 3–5 steps what they did to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>For learning languages, it could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>travel to Spain</li>
<li>hire a one-on-one tutor</li>
<li>memorize 30 words a day</li>
<li>only hang out with Spanish speakers while living in Spain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What’s the one piece of advice they would provide you?</strong><br />
Imagine you’re having coffee with these people one-on-one, and you’ve just spent 3 hours telling them everything about your situation and goals.</p>
<h3>3. ACTION Plan</h3>
<p>Once you know what you want, it’s a matter of taking massive action to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Beside each goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down chronologically the first 5 steps you need to take from as early as today in order to progress your goal. Make it as detailed as possible. **Short term**<br />
Examples: picking a name for your business, deciding to <a href="http://rypeapp.com/" target="_blank" target="_blank">hire a language coach</a>, signing up for a gym membership.</li>
<li>Now write down the 5 overarching milestones you need to meet in order to achieve your end goal. Make sure to think big this time, and many of these milestones should make you feel a little uncomfortable, but keep in mind this is who you’ll be becoming in 5 years, not today. **Long term**<br />
Examples: Raising money from VC’s, memorizing 3,000 words, quitting your job, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. What’s Stopping You</h3>
<p>If you were build a house from scratch, do you take a nail and a hammer, and just plow away at a pile of wood? Unlikely!</p>
<p>We need a plan. Better yet, a blueprint that lists what resources we need in detail and what are the specific actions we need to take to build the house.</p>
<p>We all have limitations, and a powerful way to make up for our limitations is to dissect exactly what they are.</p>
<p>What’s stopping you from achieving your goals in life?</p>
<p>Is it: failure to plan ahead? no mentor to advise you? More knowledge on a specific topic?</p>
<p>Have a clear focus of what your limitations are, and how you’ll overcome them.</p>
<h3>5. Who Do You Need To Become?</h3>
<p>The attitudes, internal beliefs, and behaviors of a successful person are rarely talked about. Yet it’s the most important driver for someone’s success.</p>
<p>What will it take to achieve your goal? Who do you need to become?</p>
<p>Will it take a great deal of discipline? Do you need to become a more productive person and manage your time better?</p>
<p>Think about the people who have already achieved the goal you want.</p>
<p>If you want to build a successful business, think about the daily routine of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. How does it compare to your current routine?</p>
<p>If you want to make it to the Olympics, think about the daily routine of Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps.<br />
Are you playing to their level?</p>
<p>Goals are never achieved from one-time events, but through the daily actions, beliefs, and routines that accumulate over a period of time.</p>
<p>Who do you need to become?</p>
<h3>6. Resources At Your Disposal</h3>
<p>All of us already have resources we can leverage to achieve our goals faster.</p>
<p>It could be your resilience and persistency, a personal connection that can open up doors, or an asset that can be re-used for different purposes, such as technology.</p>
<p>Create 3 columns with the following titles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your strengths</strong>: character traits, specialized knowledge, motivation, time, etc.</li>
<li><strong>People you know</strong>: connections that have done what you’ve done, someone that can get you in the door, a potential investor, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Current assets</strong>: financial resources, technology, tools, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then start to make a list of all the resources you can think of. Try not to overthink this, and just write as much as you can. You’ll be surprised the amount of resources you already have currently.</p>
<p>Now look back at your goals.</p>
<p>Pick one resource from each column that will bring you the maximum outcome with the least amount of resources. In other words, what are the 20% of resources at your disposal that will bring you 80% of your desired goals?</p>
<h3>7. Process Over Performance</h3>
<p>Showing up is often the hardest part in anything we do.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake most of us make is emphasizing the importance of daily performance over process.</p>
<p>Even the most professional athletes, musicians, writers, and performers across all industries have their bad days. But the difference between professionals and amateurs is: they show up. They do the work.</p>
<p>For writers, this is sitting down and writing 500-words a day, no matter how bad it may turn out. For athletes, this is waking up every morning and training, no matter how groggy and sore you feel. For language learners, it’s forcing yourself to speak everyday, no matter how many mistakes you make or how uncomfortable you may feel.</p>
<p>Focus on doing the work instead of having a perfect day, everyday.</p>
<div class="tc_pull_quote">Focus on the process, not the performance.</div>
<p>Here are a few ways to develop the habit of process over performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Think macro/long-term:</strong> According to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.3.351" target="_blank" target="_blank">this study</a> on motivation, abstract thinking can help us develop discipline as we look to future rewards by “dreaming big.” Self-determination theory also showed us that intrinsic motivation is an essential part of developing habits that stick, versus motivation through punishment and fear.</li>
<li><strong>Be boring</strong>: There’s power in being boring, according to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/94/5/883/" target="_blank" target="_blank">this study</a>. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, is well known for wearing the same colored tie and suit, in other to minimize the daily decisions he needs to make. As the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2012/09/boring-is-productive.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">Harvard Business Review</a> states, it’s better to find the mundane tasks in your life and “routinize” them as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Discover your trigger points</strong>: We all have moments when we say, “ah screw it.. I quit,” also known as the <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2011/03/the-what-the-hell-effect.php" target="_blank" target="_blank">“What The Hell”</a> effect. The key is to discover when we have those trigger points and what those trigger points are.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, according to <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/04/how-to-get-up-right-away-when-your-alarm-goes-off/" target="_blank" target="_blank">Steve Pavlina</a>, a major reason why we choose not to get up early in the morning is because the snooze button is right next to our beds. By putting it out of reach, say on the other side of your bedroom, we’re forced to get up and shut it off.</p>
<div class="tc_pull_quote">“Seventy Percent Of Success In Life Is Showing Up.” — Woody Allen</div>
<p>At the end of the day, goals are not the end all to your life purpose.</p>
<p>The tricky thing about goals in life, is that we can never truly achieve them, because they’re always changing.</p>
<p>Once we achieve a goal, we set bigger goals. Then we set even bigger goals.</p>
<p>And that’s how it should be. The point of setting goals is not to simply achieve them, but to use it in order to stretch ourselves to a level we’ve never been before.</p>
<p>What’s more important is the person we become, after the journey we have overcome.</p>
<div class="tc_pull_quote">“Goals Are A Means To An End, Not The Ultimate Purpose Of Our Lives. They Are Simply A Tool To Concentrate Our Focus And Move Us In A Direction.” — Tony Robbins</div>
<h3>Over To You</h3>
<p>List the 3 goals in life that you want to achieve over the next 12 months.<br />
Which of these methods resonated with you the most?<br />
We’d love to hear it below!<span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535560&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure data-id="535891" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1140px;"><img src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/twenty20_0947f154-368d-42fd-b289-f214088dc031.jpg?w=1140&#038;h=844" alt="Twenty20, wilhughes" width="1140" height="844" class="size-large wp-image-535891" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.twenty20.com/photos/0947f154-368d-42fd-b289-f214088dc031" target="_blank">Twenty20, wilhughes</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yesterday I came across an Instagram post reading: &#8220;A real woman is her man’s personal porn star.&#8221; </p>
<p><em>Really? </em>I thought. <em>Really?! Is that what the world has come to? </em>That the value of a ‘real’ woman is determined by her sex appeal? By what she can do for her man in the sack? **Beep! Beep! Beep!** The feminist alarms in my head were going off at full volume!</p>
<p>I was half tempted to comment on the guy’s post, call him out on how ridiculous it was. Tell him I was personally insulted. That’d teach him! Or, I’d look like that crazy feminist with her hair all frizzy around her head and an ‘I Eat Men for Breakfast’ t-shirt. </p>
<p>For some reason I didn’t comment. I guess I figured I’d save myself the social media argument. I did screen shot it though, with plans to complain about it to my girlfriends over dinner later. But the picture didn’t leave my mind. In fact, it haunted me for the rest of that day. (Mind you, I saw this at 5AM, so when I say it bugged me all day, I really mean it!) </p>
<p>I kept accidentally opening my gallery, and there it was with its black background and white letters screaming, ‘This is your self-worth. This is how you become a real woman.’ I couldn’t take it anymore. So I took the mature route and commented a face emoji that bore the expression of annoyed/eye-rolling/this-is-dumb/you-are-dumb. It looked something like this (-___-)</p>
<p>Not very mature, I realize this. But I didn’t know what to say. Do I comment on it and start an unintelligent argument about how women should be, as Pitbull would say, ‘a lady in the street and a freak in the bed’? No. Arguing for the simple fact that women are not defined by their rock star sex abilities would be completely lost on this Instagrammer. He probably wouldn’t get it. Or play it off as a harmless joke. And that’s what I hate about the internet today.</p>
<p>People are so quick to post dumb stuff without realizing: a.) the consequences, or b.) what they’re really saying about others, and more importantly themselves.</p>
<p>They don’t think that a picture basically saying a woman’s purpose is to serve her man sexually would be pretty insulting. They don’t realize that saying something ignorant like that would be a complete turnoff to some women. And they don’t realize that the internet is a complete reflection of their character. </p>
<p>The internet today has just become a place of ignorance. With a few clicks, you can lazily search for anything you need without leaving the couch. You can look up a few facts about someone and think you know everything about them. You can write posts and comments instantly, without even having to think. And thus, the mental process is lost. No check-yourself-before-you-wreck-yourself anymore.</p>
<p>If you couldn’t click and post an Instagram in a matter of seconds, would things be different? Absolutely. It’s the ease of technology, the loss of face-to-face discussion, and the media influences on what we ‘should be’ that have warped our generation. And I’m sick of it. </p>
<p>So I’m starting to do something about it…with a stale-face emoji, a screenshot, and a shaking fist. </p>
<p>Stay tuned, I might even start wearing my ‘I AM A FEMINIST’ t-shirt. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span> </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535888&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

When your BFF goes for the guy with a man bun covered in tattoos, it comes as no surprise. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535531&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<h3>1. Your attempt at wing woman somehow becomes a cock block.</h3>
<p>You&#8217;d like to think that since you&#8217;re both single (AF) you could help each other out in the &#8216;picking up men&#8217; department, but your expectations are not reality. You expect to meet two attractive young men that are also single AF, but usually one of them is engaged, and you&#8217;re stuck making small talk about what color icing his wedding cake will be. Then when your friend wants to go home with the single one, you make her walk back to your apartment with you instead. Wing woman turned cock block.</p>
<h3>2. You both are harsh critics when it comes to dating.</h3>
<p>Your BFF has your best interest at heart, so when she thinks you&#8217;re settling for less than you deserve, she is not afraid to voice her opinion. In her eyes, no one is good enough for you.</p>
<h3>3. You both date jerks.</h3>
<p>Which is most likely why you&#8217;re both still single.</p>
<h3>4. You both know each other&#8217;s type.</h3>
<p>When your BFF goes for the guy with a man bun covered in tattoos, it comes as no surprise. You both have a very distinct type of man you&#8217;re attracted to, and both of you are very familiar with exactly what type of man that is.</p>
<h3>5. You have used each other to ward off men you&#8217;re not attracted to.</h3>
<p>When that persistent guy at the bar can&#8217;t take a hint, you make up some excuse that your BFF willingly goes along with. &#8220;My friend isn&#8217;t feeling well. Bye.&#8221;</p>
<h3>6. You have twin telepathy.</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re not blood related, and you&#8217;re certainly not twins, but you are both fluent in the same unspoken language. When you&#8217;re not having fun you don&#8217;t need to say anything, she feels your pain.</p>
<h3>7. You vicariously live through your BFF&#8217;s love life when you don&#8217;t have one.</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re going through a dry spell, and the only person you text on a daily basis is your mom and your best friend, you need someone&#8217;s love life to look forward to, and it is certainly not your own. You revel in happiness when your BFF screenshots you text messages and asks you what to say.</p>
<h3>8. The world becomes a market of men.</h3>
<p>When you two do anything together in public, the first thing you notice is how many cute guys are in your radius, and how many of them are single. &#8220;Cute boy behind you, don&#8217;t look. Wait, wait, damn that is definitely his girlfriend.&#8221;</p>
<h3>9. You&#8217;ve both been asked if you were lesbian.</h3>
<p>You walk into the bar holding hands, you dance together on the dance floor, you take selfies with kisses on cheeks, and it&#8217;s completely normal, but for some reason other people think you two are in a relationship that suggests more than friendship.</p>
<h3>10. You both end up with each other at the end of the night.</h3>
<p>After you&#8217;ve been out hopelessly flirting with random men, you come home with your BFF, put on your comfiest sweats, order a pizza, and wonder what in the world you&#8217;d do without each other. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535531&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[You can never be 100 percent certain about what’s going on in your significant other’s head. Even if you feel a connection to your partner that’s stronger than anything you’ve ever known, their mind will always be their own.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535640&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure data-id="535703" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 786px;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-535703" src="https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/twenty20_d019a207-b0ba-4881-b009-cdf4293bd8902.jpg?w=786&#038;h=523" alt="Twenty20, nolimitpictures" width="786" height="523" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.twenty20.com/photos/d019a207-b0ba-4881-b009-cdf4293bd890" target="_blank">Twenty20, nolimitpictures</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The best gift you can give your partner is to wake up every day and be the best version of your authentic self. But there will be days when you&#8217;re inexplicably grumpy and there’s absolutely nothing the love of your life can do to make it better except sit there and tolerate you.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Loving someone means caring enough to give them the space they need to be an asshole or a curmudgeon some days for no apparent reason—to appreciate them when they&#8217;re at their darkest as well as their happiest. You won&#8217;t like your boyfriend or girlfriend all the time, but you won&#8217;t like yourself every day, either.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> No matter how compatible you are, you won’t agree on everything simply because you&#8217;re two different people. You&#8217;ll disagree on political candidates, throw pillows, and how much salt to use while cooking.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> And because you&#8217;re both destined to change over time, the person you&#8217;re dating might start to look different from the person you fell for to start with, which can be scary. Since we evolve as a function of our experiences (some shared, some not), the person you love today might very well develop new interests, hobbies, habits, or opinions that you don’t very much like.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> That means that you will absolutely have to compromise regularly. You will have to bargain on an ongoing basis, accepting the rug you only sort of like in exchange for the right to keep the teddy bear your boyfriend or girlfriend despises displayed on the bed year round.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Sometimes, you won’t even be able to reach a compromise. You will negotiate yourselves into a corner, at which point you might have to rely on measures like rock-paper-scissors or a good ol’ coin toss.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> And you will have to accept defeat sometimes, because you will <em>not </em>win every round of rock-paper-scissors or every coin toss because that&#8217;s life.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Your partner is definitely going to offend you occasionally—sometimes on purpose, during a massive fight because they just can’t help themselves, and sometimes totally by accident.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> There&#8217;s no one better positioned to hit you with the lowest of low blows than the person you love the most in life because they know you better than anyone else. If you abuse your power to cut deep, you have to expect an equally cruel response.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Sometimes, your partner will say or do something foolish in public. It’s your job to cover for them as best you can, and to love the fuck out of them regardless.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> Because sometimes, you’re going to make a fool of yourself, and you’ll need their support whenever that happens.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> There&#8217;s a time and a place for honesty. Sometimes, when your partner tells a joke that falls totally flat, they&#8217;ll need you to fake laugh in response to make them feel good. And if they ask whether they look okay as they rush out the door, there&#8217;s only one right answer.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> You will both probably covet other people sexually, and that’s okay. You&#8217;re both human, so you&#8217;re both susceptible to crushing on other people and/or lusting after their bodies.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Flirting can be innocent, and entertaining naughty thoughts about strangers, colleagues, or even friends doesn’t mean you love your significant other any less.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> Because love doesn’t make you immune to temptation. Resisting temptation takes work on an ongoing basis, and there’s no shame in that.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> It’s up to you and your partner to set boundaries you’re both comfortable with, and to honor those boundaries to the best of your abilities.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> No matter what, you will both fuck up. You will hurt each other over and over again because people make mistakes no matter how old they get, or how good they are at heart.</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> There will be painful times riddled with doubts and apologies and breakdowns. Times when you will have to wonder whether or not your partner will be able to forgive you, or decide to move on instead. There are never any guarantees that a person will stay with you forever, even if you&#8217;re married.</p>
<p><strong>19.</strong> And you can never be 100 percent certain about what’s going on in your significant other’s head. Even if you feel a connection to your partner that’s stronger than anything you’ve ever known, their mind will always be their own.</p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> Similarly, your relationship will always be unique from every other couple&#8217;s, and there will only be two people who ever truly get it: you, and them.</p>
<p><strong>21.</strong> Although it&#8217;s natural to make comparisons, no one is perfect and no relationship is ideal, no matter what anyone&#8217;s carefully curated social media feed says. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535640&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<h1>1. I HATE YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE DIE.</h1>
<p>“It makes me feel sick. A lot of the time I try to imagine they’re not there or something but part of it is making them feel special. Looking into their eyes is really important. I hate having to do that because I hate them all. I always have thoughts like ‘I hate you so much. Please die.” While I&#8217;m kneeling in front of them, smiling and staring into their eyes.”</p>

<h1>2. I HATE EVERY CUSTOMER I SEE</h1>
<p>“I hate every customer I see….Some guy at the club started rubbing my crotch through my panties last night. I said, ‘You can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; He said, ‘Why not?&#8221; I said, ‘Because I don&#8217;t want you to.&#8221; He looked shocked. Like&#8230; dancers aren&#8217;t just walking sex dolls? We actually have wants? The recurring theme seems to be that no matter where I go, men treat me like I&#8217;m theirs….I&#8217;m so tired of being touched and smirked at and catcalled like my body was made specifically for them to enjoy. I hate them all so much.”</p>

<h1>3. THE MEN WERE SO SCUZZY</h1>
<p>“I danced in 2002 &amp; I HATED it. The men were so scuzzy in there but generally, the women don&#8217;t mind. If they are stupid enough to hand us their $ for NOT getting laid, then that&#8217;s cool. I have never been shy about nudity, but when the OLD men or the ones who are in strip clubs for a reason (BUTT-UGLY!) &amp; want a lap dance&#8230;UGH!! That was the most degrading money I ever made &amp; the hardest. It&#8217;s not easy to pretend that you are turned on by some fat-ass loser wanting a lap dance, but that is the only way to make $ as a stripper….I didn&#8217;t hate the men. They were just being men&#8230;I hated the job.”</p>

<h1>4. SHE&#8217;S CRITICIZING YOU, LAUGHING AT YOU, MOCKING YOU</h1>
<p>“If you&#8217;ve ever given money to a stripper, you&#8217;ve probably given money to a girl or woman who has spent the last 20 minutes laughing at you, either with the other girls or on the inside. You buy a lap dance and inside she&#8217;s criticizing you, laughing at you, mocking you. She&#8217;s mocking what you’re wearing, how you’re speaking and everything about you. When a man would pay me to give him a lap dance I would spend the entire time internally laughing at his breath, his pimples, his fat belly, anything and everything I could. These women hate you, and no amount of money you can give them will make them like you any more.…So, while we may be thinking about how disgusting your teeth are, how horrible your breath is, what a stupid shirt you&#8217;re wearing and how we&#8217;d like to run a cheese grater over your smug face, we&#8217;re smiling and looking at you through submissive eyes as we robotically rub our bodies over yours.”</p>

<h1>5. HE SMELLED LIKE ONIONS</h1>
<p>“I had this one guy who really stunk. He was a college boy. He didn&#8217;t wear no deodorant. He was sweating nasty. He smelled like onions. I was in there an hour with him and I had to deal with that smell for so long. I kept, like, rubbing my nose trying to give little keys like, <em>you need deodorant</em>. It was horrible.”</p>

<h1>6. IT MADE ME REALIZE JUST HOW PATHETIC MEN ARE</h1>
<p>“I did it and it made me realize just how pathetic men are. I don&#8217;t hate them, I just hate that they come get lap dances and watch naked women dance and go home to their wives and lie about it.”</p>

<h1>7. BALDING, SLIGHTLY CHUBBY, SMALL DICK RUBBING INTO MY ASS</h1>
<p>“Girl, your man owes me 60 dollars. About your man: white, early 30s, balding, slightly chubby, suited, small dick rubbing into my ass. Your typical strip club patron….I gave him five lap dances before he claimed he did not know they were 20$ per dance, then bolted without paying me.”</p>

<h1>8. I USED TO HATE EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER FOR BEING MALE</h1>
<p>“Many of the strippers I know hate men and want to use them and unfortunately this is the outlet, one which is not ultimately powerful for women….I used to hate every single customer for being male and being in a place which uses and ranks women, but now I see individual stories and I can&#8217;t hate every single customer, especially when they tell me they know they are messed-up inside.”</p>

<h1>9. ANGER AND FRUSTRATION</h1>
<p>“There is a common belief amongst society that strippers hate men….The more common and specific scenario in which strippers can be guilty of disliking men, are quiet nights, or nights the club is swarming with men who are only interested in swigging on alcohol and being boisterous with their other drunk mates. The temporary, situational anger and frustration that derives from such nights can be quite intense. The hopelessness that is felt on one of those shitty nights can be enough to make me want to quit, within minutes an interesting, not-too-drunk-and-irritating customer who wants to pay heaps of money to hang out can wipe away that feeling. The trick is to be patient and see men as individuals, not a whole.”</p>

<h1>10. I&#8217;M A FEMALE MISOGYNIST</h1>
<p>“No, I don&#8217;t hate men. A few of them annoy me, but that&#8217;s the job. I don&#8217;t speak for all dancers but I can tell you that I&#8217;m a female misogynist. After dealing with so much bullshit from the uterine sector I will not even go near one. They are 100x more handsy and entitled than the most inebriated male customer. Just not worth the money. You wanna do us a favor, ditch the civilian vagina and come with your buddies ready to spend and have a good time. Note: there&#8217;s a .00001% group of female customers that are cool. Those are few, far between and greatly appreciated.”</p>

<h1>11. YOU&#8217;RE AN IDIOT, BUT I&#8217;M A SLUT, SO WHATEVER</h1>
<p>“When I started working as a stripper, I’d look at the other strippers and be like, ‘Eww, look at all these crack whores.” But that feeling dissipates pretty quickly. But you do judge your colleagues at first, and the strippers judge the men who come in, and the men judge the strippers, and so everyone is judging everyone, which means that everyone is fronting. But the flip side is that no one cares because you’re never going to see each other again. It’s like, ‘You’re paying $12 for a Bud Light to see my tits, which means that you’re an idiot, but I’m a slut, so whatever.” So in a way it’s kind of liberating–everyone’s just working their shit out and getting drunk and hating each other.”</p>

<h1>12. THE CUSTOMERS ARE THIS WHOLE OTHER SPECIES</h1>

<h1>13. STRIPPING IS A SOUL-SUCKING, DEGRADING JOB</h1>
<p>“I feel that overall stripping is a soul-sucking, degrading job that will drain the life right out of you if you stay too long. I’ve danced four years now and I am so worn down—physically, emotionally, and mentally. I’ve been cursed at, groped, propositioned, had objects (such as quarters) thrown at me, shoved, humiliated, insulted, licked, bit, had my clothes literally ripped off me, been rated like a piece of steak by male and female patrons of the club, talked dirty to, stalked&#8230;I’ll just stop there for now. And they wonder why many dancers hate men?? Ha&#8230;I don’t <em>hate</em> them, but I have to admit my feelings about men&#8230;and even life&#8230;have changed greatly by being a stripper.”</p>

<h1>14. I STOPPED CARING ABOUT PEOPLE</h1>
<p>“I now realize that lap dancing is one of the hardest things I ever did. I found it tough, soul-destroying, and it had begun to strip me of my humanity. I began to see everyone in terms of how much I could get out of them. I had begun to really hate men, to be bored in their company. I stopped caring about people around me because I was surrounded by this atmosphere of constant mistrust.”</p>

<h2>My Dad Died Before I Had My First Kiss </h2>
<p>I still hate phone calls,<br />
wonder,<br />
sometimes,<br />
if it&#8217;s a side effect from the grand loss.<br />
The ring makes me jump<br />
like suddenly<br />
it&#8217;s 5 AM and I&#8217;m in a hotel room<br />
with family friends so I can finally sleep.<br />
So I&#8217;m not awake with my ear pressed to the door<br />
listening to labored breathing.<br />
My stomach hasn&#8217;t settled<br />
Seven years,<br />
Some nights,<br />
I can&#8217;t even look at my phone.</p>
<p>I still hate goodbyes,<br />
wonder,<br />
sometimes,<br />
if it&#8217;s a side effect of sudden leaving<br />
not by choice<br />
but still an exit I can&#8217;t stop replaying.<br />
I tell boys<br />
I barely love<br />
to not leave me<br />
because I am afraid of the silence<br />
of waving<br />
and dusty paths that never seem to settle.</p>
<p>I still hate my mother crying,<br />
wonder,<br />
sometimes,<br />
if I didn&#8217;t do enough to soothe it.<br />
How quickly I ran into the arms of someone else,<br />
did not stay to rub her back.<br />
I kissed someone for the first time<br />
after my dad died.<br />
Is that why<br />
romance<br />
tastes a little like my own heartbreak?</p>

<h2>Things I Think About At 2 AM On His Couch</h2>
<p>The first time I let silence speak for me,<br />
I remember tasting bile in the back of my throat.<br />
Thought it was normal to feel acidity,<br />
Like maybe it was just how things happened.<br />
I would bite my tongue<br />
and you would bite it,<br />
too.<br />
It wasn’t until a doctor opened me up<br />
with scopes and cameras,<br />
said,<br />
“your esophagus looks like it’s been experiencing trauma”<br />
that I finally realized<br />
you weren’t kissing me<br />
like healthy boys do. </p>

<h2>Love Story</h2>
<p>I want you at your dirtiest,<br />
when you cannot rinse away reasons others left.<br />
Find me in the mildewed towel.<br />
We shouldn’t be wasting our water,<br />
All these droughts running rampant<br />
Let this idea that I’m running<br />
run dry,<br />
I promise,<br />
I will drink your flaws.<br />
I am thirsty for the dark,<br />
So don’t cover your mouth in the morning,<br />
Darling.<br />
Let me be your toothpaste.<br />
If I wanted the perfect story,<br />
I would have written it. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535493&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>There is a thrill in walking to and from places in the fall.</p>
<p>There is the confetti of leaves<br />
and our last frivolous act of the season is to step on them<br />
just hear them crunch.</p>
<p>There is the thrill of the darkness that comes early<br />
of the relief of going home and going to bed<br />
after a long hot summer.</p>
<p>I have always loved fall because it is the season where the things around us prepare to die.</p>
<p>I like to know that things end. </p>
<p>That there is a period at the end of a sentence.</p>
<p>That it doesn&#8217;t matter if it is a good bit of prose, or something that a student writes, we give them both the courtesy of a standard issue punctuation mark.<br />
Of acknowledging that they are over.</p>
<p>I like to know that every year winter comes. </p>
<p>The summer days don&#8217;t last. </p>
<p>That the trees will make a show of losing their leaves and then be quiet.</p>
<p>It is comforting to know we are not expected to muster up the courage to keep on going, forever. <span class="tc_mark"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/thoughtcatalog-2014/images/tc_mark.gif" alt="TC mark" /></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thoughtcatalog.com&#038;blog=7369149&#038;post=535412&#038;subd=thoughtcatalog&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

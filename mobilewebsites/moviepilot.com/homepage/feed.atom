    <title>Star Wars: The Force Awakens'  First TV Spot Shows New Footage</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What a great three days to be a Star Wars fan. 48 hours after we all woke up to see the international trailer of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a new treat has was given.  For the sake of our beating hearts, Star Wars Uk aired the first TV spot for the latest installment on Twitter earlier this morning. Earlier in the week, the public got to see the first character posters. Next,the trailer aired new footage along with extended dialogue from the film's main characters. The new TV spot builds on that and shows off more footage with more cryptic dialogue. One big similarity between the international trailer and the TV spot is the central focuses on Rey(Daisy Ridley). There is tons of eye candy and excitement in just 35 seconds as it is faster and more intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Force Awakens opens in US theaters on December 18th and the UK on December 17th.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

    <title>7 Celebrities With Identical Video Game Lookalikes!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Intentional or unintentional, some well known actors bear startling resemblance to some digital doppelgängers. These celebs weren't hired to play a virtual role, but, nevertheless, they look rather like some rather recognizable gaming icons. Check it out...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Gordon Freeman (&lt;i&gt;Half-Life&lt;/i&gt;) - Hugh Laurie&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="699813"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_564,w_878/t_mp_quality/xbvtyfd9tzfpgjohxtog/7-celebrities-with-identical-video-game-lookalikes-699813.png" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

    <title>Natalie Dormer Kissed By Jennifer Lawrence at The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 London Premiere</title>

Jennifer Lawrence was giving an interview side by side with Natalie Dormer and when finished she went to kiss Natalie who was caught by surprise and:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[yt:-Pr-1GkI2cQ]]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh my God!" &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer gasped to Natalie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We just kissed on camera, and I liked it," &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer said after apologizing for the smooch-attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The interviewer then said that she still had a little of Jennifer on her face and her answer was hilarious:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll get Jennifer Lawrence off my face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content>

    <title>Harley Quinn Army/Harley Quinn Cosplayers groups</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;figure data-id="701907"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_540,w_720/t_mp_quality/zcl2oz7l3zieybe02oyw/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701907.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all love Harley Quinn! Some of us love to dress up like her too. So I'd love to know why some of us love her? Is it because she's sexy and smart. Or because she can make you smile by saying something silly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701920"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_944,w_1678/t_mp_quality/genutbxulzonqxuckwp4/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701920.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;I asked in the Harley Quinn army group and Harley Quinn cosplayers group, why do they like her so much and why do you cosplay as Harley?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701923"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_770,w_1030/t_mp_quality/gvqd1sqllf6pyet2iano/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701923.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the cosplayers I've spoke to say they feel close to her and that she's an amazing character. So many people love the classic Harley Quinn, a lot of the people like all of her costumes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701925"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_646,w_540/t_mp_quality/hnsg8kslx0ota1nkze5t/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701925.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A lot of people have an opinion on some of Harley costumes and drawings. But we still love her. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But here is some of comments from some of the members from the groups. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701937"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_1800,w_738/t_mp_quality/zctpqo5vebg9bueqhpvr/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701937.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Abigail: I love Harley Personally as her personality is the complete opposite of my own, she is bubbly and outgoing! yet I am timid and laid back. So when I cosplay her I can break out of my shell of shyness and be happy and joyful for a day &lt;figure data-id="701943"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_486,w_540/t_mp_quality/jevzspgd0mhrwzzohawn/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701943.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Charmaine: Because I can relate to her more than I can any other comic book character that I've come across. I see a lot of myself in her and that's why I enjoy portraying her as I see it as a more exaggerated version of myself at times haha&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="701977"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_960,w_543/t_mp_quality/itgtcuqeucq2gcjaufx2/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701977.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Vee: She's a glimpse of all women encapsulated in a person.crazy,sexy,beautiful,cute.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;what do you think of the New 52?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="701982"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_1366,w_1024/t_mp_quality/fotycl9zhrzvf4eogklb/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701982.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Keikora: I love the new 52 series!! Although I'm still trying to get used to what they're doing with the Suicide Squad movie.. All around I've read a couple of the New 52 comics and they're rather dark (in my opinion) but still very good&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="701985"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_1024,w_666/t_mp_quality/mbtv4ckuwzpnvcte2s6x/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701985.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Abigail: I love the story line! And I also love her outfit, it was a very drastic jump from the classic and I don't like how they changed her blonde hair. But other than those things it's great!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="701996"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_3152,w_1988/t_mp_quality/swavefhmsfpeomtitl6w/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-701996.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been a big change from the classic jumpsuit and blonde hair, but it does give us a different look on how she's grown as a character and with out the joker. She's a more happier character and has more freedom from the joker! &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What do you think of Margot Robbie Suicide Squad movie?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702029"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_480,w_800/t_mp_quality/tenelpsveahzrxq2ilrb/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702029.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Charmaine: We can't really give a proper opinion yet as the movie is yet to come out but from the trailer and what pictures I've seen I'm very excited for this version of Harley and do think I'm going to love margot robbie's portrayal of her.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702033"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_550,w_489/t_mp_quality/ifd5ncsryhunljpyngnd/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702033.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Lito: I think Margot Robbie is gorgeous and I'm excited about her interpretation but the design leaves me a bit cold.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702042"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_640,w_640/t_mp_quality/z38wwhgnicgfty3yii74/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702042.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I do love that DC is now give us the chance to see Harley Quinn on the big screen! I do love margot Robbie and I hope she does great! But I'm also hoping they bring in some of her classic outfits as an Easter egg or something. Hopefully we'll see budd and Lou!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's your favourite Harley Quinn outfit and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702067"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_359,w_625/t_mp_quality/yx3xcd6v6wmi2myshi3x/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702067.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Charmaine: I know this is an unpopular opinion but I love the suicide squad movie outfit as soon as I saw it I loved it and knew I'd have to cosplay that outfit.I know a lot of people hate it though so don't expect anyone to agree with me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702076"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_1807,w_1024/t_mp_quality/fqtvrsh6sa63cihrbzal/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702076.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Clair: I really like the Assault on Arkham outfit as its a nod to her origin but a bit more modern and practical. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702094"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_691,w_400/t_mp_quality/thjc8gvsodu5dapyqj8s/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702094.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Injustice Harley is one of my favourites! She looks playful, cute but hot and the bells on the outfit make it work! Also she kicks so much ass looking like this! &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How did you Find Harley Quinn and what made you love her so much? &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702107"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_313,w_500/t_mp_quality/lerqmwxuupdmd1erwmt7/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702107.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Keikora: When I was a child I used to watch Batman the animated series.. back then Poison Ivy was my favorite character, but then I gradually grew to love Quinn just as much if not more&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702113"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_600,w_386/t_mp_quality/ugzxi3ejoluogjau3pe5/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702113.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Shannon: My love of the animated series as a kid, I saw a smart, fun, blonde heroin and wanted to be like her... thus a little anarchist was born &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702122"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_1000,w_665/t_mp_quality/xkq4umrnjttjlie7tmbq/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702122.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Clair: I was late to the party with this one. I fell in love with her after playing now Arkham Asylum&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We all love Harley Quinn and talking to the fans is great! So great opinions. &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure data-id="702127"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_414,w_1600/t_mp_quality/qfqmd44eb0nrhdsf5kvn/harley-quinn-army-harley-quinn-cosplayers-groups-702127.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of the members have great opinions and fun answers like!          &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;•Shannon: She's crazy, amazing, stupid but smart, a beautiful psycho that warms our hearts &lt;blockquote&gt;•Alex: Because that jumpsuit is hot!!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;•Lito:  For my wife I think it's because of the reason stated by Abigail: it allows my wife to do things like this picture. To be a silly clown, which people don't normally expect from a beautiful blonde. To come out of her shell a little. To make people laugh more, smile a lot, and appreciate her beauty and sexuality in a non-conventional presentation of sorts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Love for Harley Quinn in these groups are amazing! What do you like about Harley Quinn! &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Huge UFO filmed by Julien Solomita in Los Angeles (11-7-2015)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was dark already when the people of Los Angeles and other parts of California and Nevada witnessed something weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First watch it, then i'll continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[[yt:yu7mNmqJJ10]]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was filmed by, as you noticed Julien Solomita, Jenna Marbles boyfriend. He even said:  “it was easily the craziest thing I’ve witnessed.” I agree with him. Can you imagine just seeing that in the sky, all of the sudden?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course the government had to give and explanation and here's what they said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Navy Strategic Systems Programs conducted the scheduled Trident missile test flight at sea from the Kentucky, an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, in the Pacific Test Range off the coast of Southern California,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, the strange object appeared as a orange light moving very fast. All of a sudden, the orange light transformed into a giant blue light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it was, night flights into and out of Los Angeles International Airport now have to avoid passing over the Pacific Ocean west of the airport for the meanwhile because the U.S. military is using airspace there, reports say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Totality of Kevin Smith</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kevin Smith absolutely knows what he's talking about. I'm tempted to say "He's taken a lot of heat in the last few years because of films like &lt;i&gt;Tusk&lt;/i&gt;, and his self-admitted, damn near worshipping of pot". But the reality is that Kevin Smith has been taking heat &lt;i&gt;his entire career&lt;/i&gt;, and I think people miss that. There's always been people shitting on his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally am a Kevin Smith super fan, and the reasons for my fandom aren't just a shallow puddle of "Oh, he makes good flicks". It's because I like &lt;i&gt;Kevin Smith&lt;/i&gt; the person. I like the guy who has never been stingy about the reality of his career even existing. He's gone on for years about how lucky he is. He has taken this and used it to encourage others to "make their art", because he himself wasn't a pedigreed Hollywood kid with connection to the industry that were always going to give him a chance. He, as he has stated many times, came from a very middle class family in New Jersey, and he just took a chance on making his dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cares a lot about his fans, because his own fandom is so ingrained within him. The DVD/Blu Ray releases of his films are always packed with extras (that are actually valuable), and his Q &amp;amp; A home release version are 3-4 hours long. He's made very clear that he wants us, his fans, to be happy, because we've given him his dream (in his own words, repeated often, "I get to play make believe and get payed for it").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's also made a very active decision to make the type of movies that he wants to make, throwing a rock in the face of Hollywood. &lt;i&gt;Tusk&lt;/i&gt; is a great example of this. True Kevin Smith fans will see the film for what it is, and probably listened to the Smodcast episode where it was birthed out of playful, hilarious musing between friends (which isn't to downplay the film- it was perfectly weird, well shot, and came packed with great acting from the likes of the great Michael Parks, as well as great performances from his fellow cast mates). He's not afraid to just be who he is, take risks, and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I respect and admire Kevin Smith more than I can explain. There's &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; of lessons that can be learned from his life and career, whether you're a fan of him or not. And you'll be hard pressed to find a better orator and storyteller, regardless of whether or not you like the story that's being told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yes, Kevin Smith knows his stuff. His excitement has made me even more excited for &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;. I'm not worried about it being &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/i&gt; all over again (I also believe that Abrams simply would not let that happen; I don't think he would have taken the job if he didn't know he could kick its ass, because remember, Star Wars fans are so extreme that they ran George Lucas himself out of Star Wars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at Kevin Smith as a whole picture, and look at his complete body of work, which includes hundreds of podcasts, and I think you'll find him to be a more than an artist, and more than a storyteller. I think you'll find that he is, in fact, more than qualified to speak on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, if Mr. Smith happens to come across this article, I would love the opportunity to have even a 20 minute conversation with you. Most people would offer you sexual favors for the opportunity, but I'd like to be more original than that. I'll give you my prosthetic leg.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why 'Leatherface' is the most important film of 2016</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;figure data-id="702104"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_252,w_647/t_mp_quality/jmuhcwhzhrshhrbjgfim/why-leatherface-is-the-most-important-film-of-2016-702104.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This post is dedicated to Gunnar Hansen who died on Saturday aged 68. Gunnar Hansen is most well known for his portrayal of Leatherface in 1974's Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashers. The dominant Horror films of the 70's and 80's and arguably the most influential genre in horror of all time. What other genre manages to give people goosebumps over hockey masks and children's dolls?   Despite it's decline in the 90's however, Scream in particular was able to show that people still had some undying love for the genre. The following decade showed a small return to the genre when 'Saw' incorporated some minor slasher elements to one of the world's most profitable horror franchises.  But Leatherface has been absent from the big screen for a while; his last appearance was in 2013 and he hasn't had a well received film since 1986 though personally I find all of the film's relatively interesting, and this next installment is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been subject to various failures, most of which involve some sort of reboot-remake-prequel-sequel complicated and frankly quite boring storyline. However, with the success of the Paranormal Activity franchise I personally struggle to see why the latter hasn't led to at least some commercial success within the franchise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So why is 'Leatherface' so important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, 2016 has already had some pretty big names thrown out there. Chucky, Krueger, Myers and of course Mr.Vorhees are all set to come back soon. (Moviepilot had an article on this in June which you cam find here: http://moviepilot.com/posts/3314698)  But we know more about Leatherface than any of the others, with the directors announcing the plot synopsis and confirming that it won't be light on the gore (*Internally screaming yay*). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most significant thing is that it was originally announced as Texas Chainsaw Massacre 4 all the way back in January 2013. This obviously got many fans excited as it seemed to indicate the film would follow on from the original trilogy. However the plot's synopsis later showed that Leatherface would be a teen in this film, showing more of the characters backstory.  Yes, this is another Leatherface origin. But it is showing a younger character, meaning the audience should be able to empathise with him more because we are more likely to see a face, a rarity in the slasher genre I know but it does happen.  This origin should, if done well, therefore regain interest in the Texas Chainsaw franchise as a whole which hopefully will create a ripple effect and give the likes of Halloween and Friday the 13th equally good films providing us with a new age of slashers! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing thing 'Leatherface' will be crucial to is the future of horror on television and/or streaming services. MTV's Scream has already experienced some moderate success and hit Netflix in a dozen countries last month. A series based on Friday the 13th is also currently in development at the CW, though it's so far uncertain whether they shall be using any streaming services for the series' distribution.  Netflix (and other streaming services) essentially takes advantage of binge-watching which enables the producers to, in essence, make a 14+ hour movie. So if Leatherface and its friends are successful I shouldn't imagine it will be too long before Netflix begins to explore the genre further.  What do you think? What's your favourite Slasher franchise and which will you be waiting in line for next year? Let me know below.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Flash season 2 : Who is Harrison Wells and theory related to earth 2</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;1) Zoom&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit of zoom is shown black ....this reminds me of black flash, but it can't be black flash because he is flash hunter and when he touches a scarlet speedster, he dies that very instant. If that would've been the case, Jay Garrick would've been dead by now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can't be Jay Garrick's arch nemesis Edward Clariss because his suit has similarities with Jay's suit, and he isn't interested in killing other flashes - he just wants to avenge on Jay for taking away his glorious chance of becoming an unstoppable speedster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrison Wells seems likely to be The Zoom because -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The reverse flash with the yellow suit that is Eobard Thawne is also known as Professor Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In season 1 we saw Harrison Wells saying "that's my cue to leave" when Jay Garrick's helmet came in from the portal. That suggests that he knew about Jay Garrick, which gives an idea that he knew about earth 2 and existence of another speedster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could only know all about this if he only visited it. "That's my cue to leave" also gives an idea that Jay Garrick knew about Harrison Wells too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. In season 1 before giving the colour to his suit, it was black and the zoom of earth 2 wears a black suit too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702073"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_404,w_720/t_mp_quality/swjeajdwqnzh8htcnijb/the-flash-season-2-who-is-harrison-wells-and-theory-related-to-earth-2-702073.png" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. In episode 5 of season 2 we saw Harrison Wells giving the idea of creating a speed mirage. If we say that Harrison Wells isn't the reverse how come he was the only one who came up with this idea? Jay , being a speedster, obviously knows more ways to play with the speed than Harrison Wells, but Harrison was the only one to come up with the idea of creating a speed mirage - definitely because he did run at that speed. Don't forget in season 1 he taught Barry how to use his speed in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. He knew about Cisco's power, not that he is a metahuman but exactly  how his powers works (remember Cisco telling about his powers in season 1 to Harrison Wells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2) Metahumans of earth 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. In season 1 we saw Barry getting a sneak peek in future, this is the when we see Caitlin Snow as Killer Frost. In season 2's episode 5 Caitlin was tested negative for metahuman test courtesy of earth 2's Harrison Wells's metahuman detector watch. That gives an idea that Killer Frost may be from earth 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702074"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_404,w_720/t_mp_quality/dxqxvw3yguadhjnss04w/the-flash-season-2-who-is-harrison-wells-and-theory-related-to-earth-2-702074.png" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. We have seen Jay Garrick. In the season finale, we may see a team up of Barry with Jay against Edward(arch nemesis of Jay) with Eobard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. As we all recall Plastique died in season 1 there may be another Plastique present on earth 2 who may show up in the upcoming episodes( she is, in all possibility, alive because we have seen her in JLU animated series)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. In episode 5 of Season 2  Jay Garrick was telling Caitlin about earth 2 where he mentioned Atlantis, so there's a possibility of showing a glimpse of Aquaman or maybe Atlantis. We may see any villian from Atlantis in the upcoming episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3) This theory is a possibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702088"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_404,w_720/t_mp_quality/noubzikonmyilk5s6yzs/the-flash-season-2-who-is-harrison-wells-and-theory-related-to-earth-2-702088.png" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Harrison Wells is not reverse but another person following order of Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end of episode 5 of season 2 we saw Wells's daughter chained and kept in a cell where Zoom comes to see her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom may probably be Eobard Thawne in his original body and he's using Harrison Wells to kill Barry. Harrison is forced to do so in order to save his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4) This theory is related with DC upcoming movie Batman v Superman&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702083"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_720,w_1280/t_mp_quality/oqvrempsfmepwqkquqyk/the-flash-season-2-who-is-harrison-wells-and-theory-related-to-earth-2-702083.png" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In episode 5 of season 2 Jay mentioned about Atlantis being present on his earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In trailer of movie Batman v Superman we saw Aquaman taking steps to unite the seven seas. This brings a thought that the event of movie maybe taking place on Jay's earth and the teamup maybe due to cafighttastrophic events caused by portals acting as bridge between different earths. These portals may have connection with some other planets too, and this may bring Darkseid as an invader coming to conquer earth. Aquaman is uniting the members of Justice League so that they can prepare themselves for their worst fight..!!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Last Of Us 2 Informations by B.I.P</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Popular video game voice actor Nolan North, known for playing Nathan Drake in the Uncharted series, has caused quite a stir in the video game industry today thanks to his participation in a Q&amp;amp;A panel at MetroCon in Tampa, Florida. Earlier, he spilled the beans in regards to Visceral’s mysterious Amy Hennig Star Wars project, and now he’s seemingly confirmed the existence of what will surely be one of the most anticipated PS4 exclusives ever, The Last of Us 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702099"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_576,w_1024/t_mp_quality/ha7at1k5dlewsht57ezr/the-last-of-us-2-informations-by-b-i-p-702099.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again during his Q&amp;amp;A panel at MetroCon, North created headlines by casually confirming the existence of The Last of Us 2. A fan inquired if North was collaborating with Naughty Dog on any projects following Uncharted 4, and he responded by confirming that Uncharted 4, for the time being, would be his last time working with Naughty Dog. However, North didn’t stop there, as he followed up his statement by saying, “I know they’re doing a Last of Us 2.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702100"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_1440,w_2560/t_mp_quality/htpo7juglhmvu78qwq5v/the-last-of-us-2-informations-by-b-i-p-702100.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like a no-brainer that Naughty Dog has The Last of Us 2 in the pipeline, but the fact that North is aware of it seems to insinuate that Naughty Dog discussed it with him at some point (despite his character not surviving the first game), so development may be further along than what Naughty Dog would have us believe. They did say at one point that development on Last of Us 2 was put on hold in order for them to focus entirely on Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, which was apparently a good move as Naughty Dog ended up scrapping eight months of work on Uncharted 4. This is compounded by the fact that a LinkedIn profile used by developer Michael Knowland stated that he had worked for at least one month on The Last of Us 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702106"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_720,w_1280/t_mp_quality/nn40ho5rnx8wupqk1tno/the-last-of-us-2-informations-by-b-i-p-702106.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when can one expect The Last of Us 2? Naughty Dog’s next big project, Uncharted 4, isn’t due for release until Spring 2016, and Naughty Dog typically has two to three years between game releases. Going by that pattern, don’t expect to see anything on The Last of Us 2 until 2017 at the earliest, with the game itself releasing somewhere probably in late 2018 or early 2019 as a PS4 exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702109"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_387,w_1024/t_mp_quality/ws0v2an3t1xjhxjhq1m1/the-last-of-us-2-informations-by-b-i-p-702109.png" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many simply assumed that The Last of Us 2 was a surefire bet given the success of the first game, it’s not unlike Naughty Dog to abandon gaming franchises from one console generation to the next. It happened before with Crash Bandicoot and Jak, and they are poised to leave Uncharted behind as well, as Uncharted 4 is looking to wrap up the story of Nathan Drake. Considering Naughty Dog’s history of leaving well-established franchises behind coupled with the jaw-dropping cliffhanger that capped off the original Last of Us, it’s good to have a little extra reassurance that The Last of Us 2 is in development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702110"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_450,w_943/t_mp_quality/t2l77tao364q0dsju2it/the-last-of-us-2-informations-by-b-i-p-702110.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Last of Us 2 has no release date in sight, but barring a mountain of delays during development that pushes it to next-gen, it’s most definitely coming exclusively to PlayStation 4 at some point in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you think,when,how it gonna show up? &lt;br&gt;Share with us what you think about The Last Of Us 2 and keep following me for more!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>3 Future Events that could drastically change 'The Walking Dead'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;'The Walking Dead' is currently in its sixth season and it's going just as strong as when it started. With Alexandria being attacked by the Wolves and Morgan becoming a main character, there's no denying that the most popular zombie show on tv isn't showing signs of slowing down. But along with its story and character development, its been pretty faithful to their roots, including how the governor is killed and the inclusion of the infamous "tainted meat" line. Here are three things that happen in the graphic novels that could have huge impact if they happened on the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Rick losing his right hand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701993"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_766,w_1022/t_mp_quality/dqnocd58h2clzmfxnasz/3-future-events-that-could-drastically-change-the-walking-dead-701993.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when the group was living at the prison and facing off against the governor, Rick was captured and had his right hand cut off by the one-eye dictator himself. He was eventually rescued but this gave him a huge disadvantage in shooting and hand to hand combat. Many suspected that Merle would be the one to do it to Rick in season three as revenge for leaving him handcuffed to a roof in Atlanta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Attack on Alexandria&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701998"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_600,w_500/t_mp_quality/y2c5cd8mtewo4dliro2b/3-future-events-that-could-drastically-change-the-walking-dead-rick-leading-his-army-to-701998.png" alt="Rick leading his army to war" title="Rick leading his army to war"&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;Rick leading his army to war&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Volumes 20 and 21 of the comics, Rick must lead the communities of Alexandria, Hilltop , and the Kingdom into war against a major threat known as the Saviours. Fighting off the bad guys is one thing but could you imagine having to go to WAR against an army of them? To put it in perspective, imagine if a group the size and scale of the Woodbury army (with grenade launchers and all that) trying to invade Alexandria. That would do a number on them. Ammunition would run low, the casualty rate would be devastating, and the amount of zombies that would overrun the place in the aftermath would be so large that the only option would be for the heroes to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Carl gets shot...again&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="702031"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_693,w_620/t_mp_quality/cwobnifs1vgoin5bovxd/3-future-events-that-could-drastically-change-the-walking-dead-702031.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As seen in season two, Carl, who is still just a "useless kid" at this point, gets shot when a bullet passes through a deer. He survives but what if he were shot again and it changed him physically and drove his father insane? In the comics he is shot in the eye and falls into a coma, one that Rick is unsure if he will wake from. If Carl were to lose his eye on the show, his father would become more deranged and maybe become the very threat Alexandria feared he would become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it from me, but what do you think? What event from the graphic novel do you want to see play out on your tv screen? Comment down below or send me a tweet at @thejamesewart&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>The Batman Film We Deserved</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;figure data-id="701956"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_914,w_1200/t_mp_quality/g3vssp3ffuu3d4unolea/the-batman-film-we-deserved-701956.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the coming of the new Batman Versus Superman Dawn of Justice movie, I thought that a review of all Batmans was required. Note that I do not go into animated series here, because then Kevin Conroy would have no comparison, not to mention that the 1992-1995 series is far better than any movie that has come so far, including the Dark Knight Trilogy. After closely watching all of the Batman live action movies in one go(believe me, I have a very sad life), I came to one main conclusion: Bale and the Dark Knight Trilogy is the best Batman portrayal on screen. Now, I can see a lot of fan boys of Michael Keaton rising up with pitchforks and tar, but I will elaborate on this the best I can. As for the Val Kilmer fan boys, tough luck. The Clooney film fans, please stay 10 km away from me at all times, especially when you are wearing leather. Now then, on to the show:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Bale portrayed the most realistic Batman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701957"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_900,w_600/t_mp_quality/hhrqgcnv7iwrdfmxnkdc/the-batman-film-we-deserved-701957.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Batman story, I think, is more about the man than about the hero. Older comics tend to keep Batman grounded in reality, an orphan with a thirst for vengeance and a large bank account who travels the world learning different styles of martial arts to come back to Gotham and defeat the city's criminals. All of the Batman major villains with the notable exceptions of Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy are heavily grounded in reality. The Joker(psychopath with possible schizophrenia), Penguin(mob boss), Court of Owls(murderers with training and cloning), Scarecrow(fear toxin), Two Face(multiple personality disorder), Ras Al Gul(vigilante) and even the Mad Hatter(psychedelic drugs and god complex). These are the archetypal Batman villains, not the ones in crossovers and Justice League. Therefore the portrayal in the movies was in keeping with the spirit of Batman. Nolan created a Batman that was not superpowered or had unbelievable gadgets. He created the man first in Batman Begins, showed us that he was fallible, arrogant sometimes, yet he won through because he knew how to handle these people. The previous movies wshowed a Batman that was a) Able to navigate while free falling from space(Clooney) b) could not beat a bunch of Penguins in Gotham(Keaton) c) told his identity to a beautiful woman he just met or kept it so insecure that everybody finds out(here both Keaton and Kilmer are guilty, as well as Clooney in the way the Batgirl finds out). I personally didn't like the Keaton Batman for the way he waves his cape to scare people, nice but overdone I think. Also, Bale's Batman stands out for the way his character grows throughout the series, his relationships with Gordon, Robin(in the last film), Alfred and Fox to name a few. The only flaw here I see with Bale was that his Batman voice was a little bit overdone according to most fans though I liked it. Adam West's Batman was a bit too campy and overdone to merit any serious discussion though some fans find it enjoyable. Oh, and leather nipples? Sorry Clooney, not good at all. Nor was the way Batman couldn't find a cure to Ivy's toxin even by the end of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The villains were far more grounded and believable:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701961"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_280,w_200/t_mp_quality/usaw6fbltiaticc21uwi/the-batman-film-we-deserved-701961.png"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the villains of the earlier Batman series were, in one word, horrible. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze was one of the worst castings ever done. Poison Ivy in the same movie seemed like some ditzy blonde rather than the femme fatale we expect. Penguin in Batman Returns was far more better but a little too much focus on the name rather than the character was done which made him seem comical at times. Harvey Dent in Batman Forever seemed more of a crazy nutcase instead of a real split personality gone haywire and seemed a trivial villain compared to the one we see in the Dark Knight, the fall from being the hero to becoming the villain. Tommy Lee Jones was a good choice but he ultimately I guess had bad lines and even worse direction. I personally love Jim Carrey but Riddler is one who deals with riddles and is intelligent to a fault. The making of some mind reading device seemed too much of a cop out rather than a utilization of that brilliant mind. I expected Riddler to be more like the one portrayed by Cory Michael Smith in the recent Gotham. Morbidly fascinating and always over the precipice to becoming an overly intelligent villain. Jack Nicholson's joker is the only contender when it comes to good villains, but again, the portrayal by Heath Ledger takes the prize. While the Nicholson joker and his origin story stays true to the comics, the Ledger joker is better because he was more of a criminal mastermind, a man who calculated all of the possibilities. Not to mention had better lines. Compare: "Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?" to "Oh, you. You just couldn’t let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You are truly incorruptible, aren’t you? Huh? You won’t kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness. And I won’t kill you because you’re just too much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever." Throughout the Dark Knight, there is this pervading sense of helplessness in Gotham due to the Joker. A criminal we can't see, who could have any pawn in his plan, who could strike anywhere. Bane was also no comparison, the Bane in Batman And Robin was a bumbling oaf with brute strength compared to the masterful martial arts expert and criminal genius that was Bane in the Dark Knight Rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) Gadgets and the Bat vehicles were far too weird in the other Batman series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701963"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_133,w_280/t_mp_quality/ib3dearp7uxnwrz9mr57/the-batman-film-we-deserved-701963.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batman does have a collection of great gadgets to use. But in the previous Batman films, most of the gadgets were like easy escapes in bad situations. Can't blow up something? Use a Batarang with a bomb attached. Can't escape? Use a laser device. Also, I really didn't see the point of Bruce Wayne using normal vehicles like a power boat or a small airplane and the only difference being that his would be 'BATIFIED'. Most of the early incarnations of the Batmobile looked like they had a jet engine attached to the back which was also unbelievably dumb as to the power source and the maneuverability of such a craft. Oh and Adam West's Batmobile was like the nirvana of superheroes in trouble. Interesting but ultimately too fake. The Humvee design may have looked ugly but kinda made sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) No main character that you care about enough dies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know whether to classify this as good or bad. But nobody important dies in any of the Batman films.The death of Nora in Batman and Robin was kinda tragic and sad, until they make her out to be not dead again. Similarly, the death of Catwoman in Batman Returns was something that might have made the movie epic but again she is shown to be alive at the point where the bat signal is turned on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701966"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_210,w_280/t_mp_quality/tmfjlffkxr4xwrxjvxuj/the-batman-film-we-deserved-701966.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alfred feeling a little blue? Don't worry, Mr Freeze already invented the cure. Again something that could have improved that horrible movie, but nooo, we'll just hope Clooney can win us some money. Penguin's death was a bit sad which is why I would rate that movie better than most in this regard. Bruce's parent's deaths are also something that should make us feel, but apart from Batman, noone decides to use this moment and even there it is the briefest of flashbacks. Compare all these to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Rachel's death hits us hard, as does Harvey's fall and Bruce's parent's shooting. Here the t.v series Gotham deserves an important mention as it has topped it. If the Dark Knight Rises had killed off Batman properly, it would be an even greater movie than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) Far better stories and supporting character development:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Batman film series has developed the rest of the cast more than the Dark Knight trilogy. Alfred, Rachel, Lucius, Gordon all are very well written and developed. 3 movies probably does give it an unfair advantage here though. Alfred is well developed, but the women in Bruce Wayne's life are too variable as is the pathetic development of Gordon. Robin is almost a Mary Sue, typical lackadaisical sidekick despite being in two movies. The stories could also use a little work. Blow up the city with emperor penguins for being scorned when running for mayor? Kinda self destructive because the sewers where you live are also beneath the city. Freeze the entire city for your wife's death? Sure but why the hell would Poison Ivy support you, plants die in the cold. Batman is in the room with you and Max is probably going to die from a the taser but let's bite it together just to make sure. Oh and Batman reveals his true identity to any woman that has even the slightest liking for him. And he loves sidekicks too, the more the merrier without regard for age or schooling or safety in that matter. Batman Forever was a bit better than this but Batman and Robin was just terrible in this regard. Also, if Riddler knows everything about the world, why doesn't he use some sort of missile system and it's codes to target Batman in his home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-id="701968"&gt;&lt;img class="cld-responsive" alt="" title="" src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_214,w_280/t_mp_quality/n7khbqmamac4dmliq8hf/the-batman-film-we-deserved-701968.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that ends my blog post about it. Like I said before, we all have our likings for Batman, but this is my analysis.  Ben Affleck has big shoes to fill for sure. Let's all hope the new Batman doesn't fail our hopes and aspirations after such a good series.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>If 'Star Wars' Was Made In The Present Day: Who Would Play Our Iconic Characters?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star Wars &lt;/i&gt;has risen to the top of the charts as one of cinema's most iconic movie sagas. The movie has everything; quotable lines, amazing visual effects, and a great cinematic universe. But what I thought stood out the most, was the iconic characters. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia; these are the actors that we think of when we hear the words &lt;i&gt;Star Wars.&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Would The Cast Of Star Wars Look Like If It Was Made In The Present Day?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who would play our favorite &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; characters? Well, I am here to hopefully answer that question. I have what I think are the best choices for the cast of &lt;i&gt;Star Wars &lt;/i&gt;if it was made in the present day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Robert Boulter - Luke Skywalker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="698571"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_319,w_258/t_mp_quality/etmnqdempcfyzypom623/if-star-wars-was-made-in-the-present-day-who-would-play-our-iconic-characters-698571.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Boulter is already rumored to playing the young Luke Skywalker in &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&lt;/i&gt;, so he already has the credentials to play one of the most iconic roles in movie history. He has the looks, and would arguably make a better Luke than Mark Hamill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mary Elizabeth Winstead - Princess Leia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="698563"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_1200,w_1920/t_mp_quality/xrnsatkh4gtm2k3mzzdr/if-star-wars-was-made-in-the-present-day-who-would-play-our-iconic-characters-698563.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she's Carrie Fisher, I think Mary Elizabeth Winstead would make an excellent Princess Leia. She has the looks to pull off the character, but also the toughness that comes along with Princess Leia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sam Claflin - Han Solo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="698568"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_640,w_626/t_mp_quality/kzd5tlkqibvvzosetltb/if-star-wars-was-made-in-the-present-day-who-would-play-our-iconic-characters-698568.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already a fan favorite of the &lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games &lt;/i&gt;trilogy, Sam Claflin has the acting skill and personality to play our favorite space smuggler. Although he may be a little young for the role, I think he would have made up for it in his charm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;James Earl Jones - The Voice Of Darth Vader&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure data-id="698574"&gt;  &lt;img src="http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_fill,h_395,w_636/t_mp_quality/qauyyk1uhxkxxxws5zmq/if-star-wars-was-made-in-the-present-day-who-would-play-our-iconic-characters-698574.jpg" alt="" title=""&gt;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, he was in the original trilogy. But the reason that he's on this list is because he is simply the best at what he does. I, as well as every other &lt;i&gt;Star Wars &lt;/i&gt;fan, couldn't imagine a world where James Earl Jones didn't voice the most iconic villain of all time. That's good enough reason to put him on this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;And As Always, Thanks For Reading&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Strage Timeliine</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a life long comic book fan and collector. I don't think that this will be a major problem with the time line of the MCU for a few reasons. Marvel Movies have already taken some liberties in introducing characters and their back stories how they saw fit (i.e. original members of the Avengers, Ultron, THE MANDARIN, just to name a few).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking that into consideration and now looking at Doctor Strange, you cannot have an unlimited awareness of every MCU character whenever a movie is made. We have to give the movie makers some benefit of the doubt to weave a plausible connection between the two or more films and keep it moving. Movies have never and will never be pinpoint accurate compared to their comic book counterparts so I think that a lot of the commentary that we hear should take this into consideration and try to enjoy and critique the film itself that's at hand. Once any adaptation is made then by definition it's not the same as the original. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date I've enjoyed all of the Marvel movies, some more than others but I can't say that due to the inaccuracies of the timeline or origination of the characters according to the director or producer perspective, that I have not enjoyed the films. I do share in some of the disappointments of these inaccuracies however I try not to let that prevent me from enjoying the movie and seeing if what they did do was good within their own parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm very excited to see Doctor Strange. As a kid I thought that he had the most potential of be a realistic character than all of the other favorites of mine. I do have high hopes for this movie and I hope that they get the special effects right!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Why Gaston Is Neither the Bad Guy Nor the Hero</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gaston is most certainly not the hero, but nor is he the villian. He has horrible and rash decision making skills, he's conceited, he's sexist, he's arogant. BUT, that being said, he always has a good intention. Forcing Belle to marry him is because he thinks she will make a good wife and because she is beautiful. I agree that her intelligence does set her apart from the other women, yet still he was attracted by her beauty. Killing the beast was something he intended to do to save the woman he loved, her father, and his town, even though WE, as an audience, know that the beast is tame at heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Gaston is stupid and selfish and crazy, but he isn't solely the bad guy; I think the true antagonist in this Beauty and the Beast is circumstance. &lt;/p&gt;</content>

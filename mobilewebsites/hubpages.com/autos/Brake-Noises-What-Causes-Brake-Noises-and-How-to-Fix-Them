<h2 class="subtitle">Brake Noises: Annoying or Dangerous?</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_15564068"><p>“My brakes squeak” is one of the most common complaints about brakes. Brake noises can be annoying, but can also alert us of an upcoming danger. It's best to play it safe and have brake noises checked by a trusted mechanic.</p>
<p>I will cover three of the most common brake noises I encounter on a daily basis and try to shed some light on the repair.</p>
<p>Some of the repair techniques I share with you here are unorthodox and you will never find them in a service manual or Technical Service Bulletin.  If you decide to try them please be cautious and safe.</p>
<p>Let’s check out the three most common problems that cause noisy brakes.</p></div>

</div>
<div id="mod_15564255" class="module moduleText color0">
<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_15564255"><p>Hearing a grinding noise when you apply your brakes is really like hitting a rumble strip on the edge of the highway; if you hear this, you need to wake up and stop driving. A grinding noise on braking is usually caused by a lack of brake pad material; the pads and rotors are now metal to metal, with no braking material left.</p>
<p>Brake pads are like bars of soap. Eventually they get used up, and you have to replace them and spend a little money.</p>
<p>If you don’t, and your brakes get to the point of grinding, just imagine dollar signs rising into the air every time you step on the brake pedal, even just a little. The grinding noise is just a little voice whispering in your ear saying, ”You’re killing me!” Mechanics have an acronym for this, it’s called CPR (calipers, pads, and rotors). And when you get the bill for your brake job, you will need CPR (cardio-pulmonary rescuscitation).</p>
<p>If your brakes are grinding, stop driving and call a tow truck. It’s worth it in the long run.</p></div>

<div id="mod_38479499" class="module moduleCallout color0">
<div id="38479499_callout"><div class="callout colorbox"><p class="">2. Thumping Noise From the Rear When Braking</p></div></div>
</div>
<div id="mod_15564280" class="module moduleText color0">
<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_15564280"><p>This brake issue is one that will annoy the hell out of the driver, and suck the life out of the technician. It took me months to figure out what caused this thumping noise in the rear of a vehicle when braking. After tearing apart the rear of the vehicle, lubing every bushing, and checking the clearances of every part imaginable, I came to the conclusion that it’s the rear drums that cause the noise.</p>
<p>Many cars have drum brakes in back, where a shoe stops the car by pressing on the inside of a metal drum. Brake drums, like rotors, get resurfaced once in a while. The cutting bit on the brake lathe removes the old braking surface and leaves a nice new mating surface. During this procedure, the cutting bit will create a groove in the brake drum so slight that the naked eye can’t see it; it’s like a groove on a vinyl record that the needle of the record player follows.</p>
<p>When the brake shoes ride on the new surface, they will follow the groove like the needle of your record player follows a track. If the groove is interrupted, the shoes snap back, hitting the backing plate. This phenomenon happens very quickly, causing a thumping noise that will drive you crazy and wondering if your car is falling apart or even safe to drive.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this noise. One is to replace the rear drums. A second way, less drastic, is to remove the drums, install them on a lathe, and sand the crap out of the mating surface with coarse sandpaper. The third way I found by trial and error and pure frustration is a quick fix using the emergency brake.</p>
<p>You will not find this procedure in any service manual or car repair manual, not even on car repair talk radio. It can be dangerous if not performed correctly so please be careful. Nevertheless, I have done it on over 100 cars, including family members’ cars, and I would not recommend it if I thought it damaged the vehicle.</p>
<p>How this works is that you get your rear brakes to do 100% of the braking for a few seconds at a time, instead of their usual 30%, and this will cause the brake shoes to polish the grooves out of the drum. For safety reasons, only try this on cars that have an emergency brake handle in the center console; emergency brakes that come up out of the floor can’t be set and released quickly enough.</p>
<p>Drive your car in a remote area with little or no traffic at a speed of about 40 miles an hour. Lightly pull up on the emergency brake handle <em>while holding the release button; </em>this is so the emergency brake handle won’t lock in the braking position, and you can release it quickly. Only hold the emergency brake on for about three seconds because you don’t want to overheat the drums. Do this three to five times, while keeping a steady speed; the noise should disappear, or at least be 90% gone. Then drive the car at normal speeds and use the brakes the way you normally would.</p>
<p>If the noise has not changed, you may have a different thumping noise than what I have described here in this article. Give up on this remedy and try something else.</p>
<p>My sister came to me with this noise after she had her brakes checked at her local garage. They had adjusted her rear brakes so the emergency brake handle had less free play in it, and this is when her troubles began. I took her car out on a test drive for about 10 minutes, performed the procedure described here, and poof, the noise was gone. She was happy because the garage that had caused the noise had no idea how to fix it.</p></div>

<div id="38479508_callout"><div class="callout colorbox"><p class="">3.  "My Brakes Squeak"</p></div></div>
</div>
<div id="mod_15564328" class="module moduleText color0">
<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_15564328"><p>A brake squeak can be very annoying, and furthermore might mean something. It may be a sign of danger of some kind, or it may just be a sign of cheap brake pads.</p>
<p>The most common brake squeak is caused by inferior pads. A cheap brake job sounds good when you’re paying for it, but it may come with years of painfully annoying brake squeaks. Cheap brake pads have large metal flakes in the brake material, and when you press the brakes lightly and a flake drags along the rotor, it will squeak. The squeak may go away when that particular flake wears away, but usually there is another metal flake right behind it. The best way to avoid this type of noise is to choose quality brake pads.</p>
<p>If your brakes are squeaking or squealing while driving down the road, but the noise goes away when you press on the brakes, I have a hunch that your brake wear indicator is hitting the rotor and causing the noise. The wear indicator is a small metal tab fastened to the brake pad. When the brake pads are worn down and need replacing, this metal tab starts to drag along the rotor, warning the driver of the potential problem. Don’t ignore the noise too long; the brake pads are thin and need servicing very soon, for safety and to protect the other parts of the braking system.</p></div>

<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_38479565"><p>I have one other noise I run into a lot that has nothing to do with the brakes themselves—technically, it has to do with rotors—but I thought it was worth mentioning here because it comes from that area, and a lot of customers assume it's their brakes causing the noise. If your vehicle makes a scraping noise, while driving or when turning a corner, that sounds like something being dragged across a tin plate, it's possible you have picked up a rock from a dirt road or from a freshly repaired pothole: the kind of place where you hear a shower of pebbles hitting the bottom of your car as you drive through. There’s a good possibility that a rock has gotten lodged between the rotor and the backing plate, making an awful noise that is causing your ears to bleed. Just have the rock removed and be on your way.</p>
<p>Or sometimes the backing plate behind the rotor gets bent while the car is being worked on, and it scrapes against the rotor.</p></div>

As a safety precaution, manufactures want to make sure you are stepping on the brakes before you put the transmission in gear, so the gear shift selector has a solenoid that is energized buy stepping on the brake pedal, thus releasing the gear shift lever from it's locked position. So if your car will not come out of park, have someone see if your brake lights are working at the same time the shift lever is stuck, if the brake lights are not working, replace the switch.</p><p class="">Hope this helps, if you have any questions, let me know, take care Gladys.</p></div></div><hr>

For a few days ive been hearing a grinding noise when i back up or hit my brakes to slow down/stop. After driving for a bit, it disappears. I like the "stone or rock trapped between the pad/rotor" idea you suggest. But should this sound just "disappear" like its been? Then the next time i move, probably most cases, the next day, the sound from the car is back? Weird. Plan on calling the dealership or just a local place to take a look but wanted to sift around a bit for answers. Thanks for any insight you might have.</p><p class="">2010 toyota matrix AWD ...

Or was the brake pedal low before all this work was done?</p><p class="">Gravity bleeding is easy but time consuming. First you have to make 4 brake bleeding bottles, clear plastic if possible, like a Gatorade bottle. Drill a hole in the cap, then put a piece of 1/4'' rubber hose through the hole until the hose reaches the bottom of the bottle,(this is so you can watch the flow of brake fluid from each tube and the air bubbles coming from the tube) make sure the hose inside the bottle is submerged in brake fluid to prevent air from getting in the system vie the hose, leave about a 12'' of hose out the top of the bottle, connect all 4 bottles to the bleeders at each wheel, fill the reservoir, and then open all 4 bleeders , keep an eye on the master cylinder reservoir and top off as needed. Watch all the bleeder hose for the bubbles to stop, once you're confident the air is out of the system, close all bleeders.</p><p class="">If you don't know how to adjust rear drum brakes, you can have someone do it for you or you can attempt it yourself. I found a video on YouTube for you, go to the 16 min mark on the video.  <a href="http://youtu.be/dS5bwkwgQDA" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/dS5bwkwgQDA</a></p><p class="">Let me know how you make out Bryan or if you have any other questions, take care for now.</p></div></div><hr>

And do you know if you have brake shoes or pads in the rear? It may just be pad shift , but without hearing the noise it's difficult to diagnose. If your mechanic just replace your rear brakes, you should bring it back to the shop and have them check their work, they may have installed something wrong. I'll wait to hear back from you on those two questions.</p></div></div><hr>

Some manufacturers have started using an organic material for the pads which are extremely quiet, but cheep pads usually have large chunks of metal throughout the pad material, those chunks are what cause the brake squeak/squeal. I would have to say the mechanic is tell you the truth on this one :) Let me know if you have any other questions skylarboo, you know where to find me :)</p></div></div><hr>

If the rotors were resurfaced sometimes for the first couple hundred miles, the brakes make that kind of noise, the noise is caused by not doing a finish fine cut. What happens is the cutting bits leave deep grooves in the rotor on the rough cut, like a vinyl record. The grooves are not noticeable with the naked eye. It's not dangerous, just annoying.

I'm glad that I finally came across this article!  I have a 1990 Honda Accord.  As I'm driving I can hear a metal tinging sound, kind of like hangers clanking together.  It's subtle, sounds like thin metal, and it seems to make noise with bumps in the road.  I'm pretty sure it's coming from the rear passenger side.  In addition, every so often I'll get a thumping noise from the same area.  It speeds up as I accelerate and slows down as I decelerate.  The thump goes away after I brake to a near stop.  Do you think this is a brake drum issue?  I can't see anything visible in the area that's out of the ordinary.  I just tried taking the drum off to inspect inside.  I loosened it and could pull it off about 1/4 and that's as far as I could go.  I used the banging and bolt methods.  No luck getting it off.  Anyway,  am I looking in the right place as to the culprit of these noises?  Thank you!</p></div></div><hr>

Remove the plug in the rear of the backing plate and use a drum spoon or brake adjuster spoon to back off the adjuster. Once you have the drums off, you may need to have them resurfaced or replace. This may take care of the thumping noise, I'm not 100% sure, but it might.</p><p class="">The thin metal rattle noise is probably caused by the heat shield on the top of the "B" pipe, it's very common to have the bolts rust off and cause a rattle noise. I recommend checking all the heat shields on the exhaust, top and bottom of the pipes, not the shields mounted to the bottom of the vehicle.</p><p class="">Let me know what you find Chris, and if you have other questions or you want to give me more information, I'll be right here :)</p></div></div><hr>

I replaced all of the shoes in the rear and added some lube to the backing plate.  The car is riding like new again!</p><p class="">The old pads were worn down but they didn't seem worn enough to cause any problems.  However, the shoes were tight against the backing plate and not able to move easily.  On the problem wheel, I found two decent sized metal pieces that were lodged in the area where the drum meets the plate.  They had broken off of the drum edge.  I think this what the metal tinging noise that I heard.  I should mention that the noises that I described in my last post changed.  The tinging and thump went away and became a metal scraping sound when I would turn in the direction of the problem wheel and would intensify if I pulled on the emergency brake.  It sounded so bad that I parked the car and stopped driving it for a couple weeks.</p><p class="">When I was having trouble removing the drums, I gave in and took it to the shop.  I paid a diagnostic fee for them to tell me that they could hear a lot of noise and that they would replace part after part of the suspension until the problem was resolved.  The estimate was starting at $800 and it said it could cost more.  I was mad because I don't think they even put it on the lift to do a visual inspection and I know they didn't open the drum.  With the help of a snake camera, I was able to see the adjuster wheel and get those drums off.  It cost me a total of $30 to do this repair.  My figures are crossed!  Thanks for your article and helping me find the solution!</p></div></div><hr>

If a shop or mechanic ever tells you they need to replace parts until it fixed, don't walk away, RUN!!! To me that is just plain lazy, they can't even consider themselves mechanics, we call them parts replacers.</p><p class="">I'm glad you took the initiative to figure out the rear brake adjuster, it's a very simple design, but a bit confusing if you have never had to deal with it, now you can adjust your rear brakes when the parking brake feels low or your brake pedal feel low :)</p><p class="">After replacing shoes, adjust the rear brakes so that the shoes are just starting to hit the drum, to do this, pull up on the e-brake to center the shoes, then spin the drum while adjusting the shoes, once you feel slight drag on the drum, stop, your done. Do both sides and then check your e-brake, it should come up 3-7 clicks.</p><p class="">When ever I replace rear brakes, I'll usually tap off all the rust on the drum with a small hammer, that just prevents chips from breaking off in the future and causing the scraping noise you had.</p><p class="">If you ever need any advice or you have more questions Chris, you know where to find me, and if you could push that little Facebook like button to the right for me, that would help me out big time :) Thanks Chris!</p></div></div><hr>

What happens is the shoes wears the grease or lube off the backing plate over time at the contact point, then it rust and starts making a squeak noise as you push the brake pedal, it just caused by the brake shoes rubbing on the backing plate with no lube, it's not dangerous, just annoying.</p><p class="">An easy fix is to remove the drum and lube each contact point on each shoe where it meets the backing plate, or have a rear brake job done by someone who knows what they are doing :) Mention that you have the squeaking noise so they are prepared to lube the contact point when replacing the shoes.

I actually experienced squeaking/grinding noises back in May for 3 or 4 days, it just as suddenly stopped. Then again last month, it was louder. Then stopped after a few days. These incidents seemed to coincide with wet and/or humid weather. It sounds like I'm dragging something, but I don't see anything amiss. Everything under hood looks okay. I'm flummoxed.</p></div></div><hr>

Sometimes while driving over freshly filled potholes or a paved road, you can hear all the little rocks hitting the bottom of the car, sometimes these rocks get stuck in the wheels and brake assemblies and cause noises, the noise usually sounds like a pie plate dragging on the ground. Let me know if this sounds like your noise Susan, thanks.</p></div></div><hr>

I can't see anything stuck. I stopped at the garage I use and the mechanic thought it was the brakes, but I guess he'll be able to tell better when he takes things apart. This is a garage where I don't have to worry about the mechanics; they never try to sell a bit of goods you don't need so I think if it turns out to be something else, it won't be a problem. I'm bringing it tomorrow morning. It makes noise whether I'm using brakes or not. Trifle louder when I brake but the brake light hasn't gone on (and when I needed brakes in 2006, believe me, it did!) Wheel bearing, maybe? Or hopefully what you suggested, it would be a relatively easy fix. I drove around to do errands over the weekend- didn't get worse- or better.</p></div></div><hr>

I have a question for you and I'm not sure if it's the brakes or if I'm just assuming the worst. I have a 2005 Camry LE (4 cylinder), I had my brake pads replaced around April of 2012, they've been working just fine. But sometimes if I'm driving at a high rate of speed (usually around 60-80mph on the highway) and I have to start braking, I hear this 'whomp" sound. I'm not sure if that's the most accurate sound to describe but the vehicle doesn't shake or "chug" when braking. Also the other day I noticed while driving around town running errands that my brakes again made that whomp whomp whomp sound when braking from 45 mph. I hear the noise in the front of the vehicle, more on the passenger side. I'm not TOO concerned as my brakes work and I think I read somewhere that that's a feature of Toyota when braking from a high speed but I wanted to get your advice. Thanks for your help!</p></div></div><hr>

The whomp whomp whomp  noise is probably caused by the drums.</p><p class="">The drums start out completely round (New), and over time they become oval because of heat and normal wear. It's nothing to worry about, but when you have your next rear brake job, the mechanic will probably resurface the drums and the nose should subside.</p><p class="">Let me know if this makes sense to you Amanda, and if you have any other questions or concerns, I'll be right here :)</p></div></div><hr>

Great information. My dilemma/ question (which hopefully you haven't already answered 100 times) is that when slowing down my front right wheel makes a whirring/ rubbing sound. It's when I get down to about 20 mph or less. Don't have to hit the brakes to hear it. My vehicle is a 2007 Ford Expedition EL. I've had a mechanic look at my rotors and pads and tell me they are both fine. The noise is driving me nuts!!! What could it be?</p></div></div><hr>

Not the sound I'm hearing. We don't hear the noise at all unless we are slowing down and our vehicle doesn't shake at all. The noise also goes away sometimes when the weather is really rainy. The last mechanic that heard the sound didn't look at the vehicle but did hear the sound. He said he thought the rotors may have a slight groove in them and that when the pad and rotor are meeting together they're rubbing. Also that there might be a little dirt in between the two. Said that that didn't mean either needed to be replaced but that I might have to deal with the sound until something went bad. I know I know my vehicle the best and may be picky with it but I don't want to have to hear this sound when slowing down.</p></div></div><hr>

Some car manufactures use brake shoes on the inside of the rear brake rotors, if your's has this type of e-brake system, something may have came apart inside the drum, Or, its' possible you picked up a rock and it's lodged between the rotor and backing plate, ether problem will need to be looked at by a mechanic asap. Let me know what you find Catherine, I'm very curious, thanks.</p></div></div><hr>

I have a 2001 Dodge Caravan Sport and have repeatedly had to have front brakes replaced.   One of last times I had the front brakes done, they needed to be replaced again (rotors and pads) in less than a year (wouldn't pass inspection here in NH)  10 months after that, same garage said  the rear brakes were gone requiring new drum, wheel cylinder, everything - but only one side?

(PepBoys, Vip) You could try OEM brakes (original equipment) they may last longer with less noise, or you could trade the Caravan in for an Odyssey with far less problems and a better trade in value, lol. Sorry bad joke :)</p><p class="">Your question does't have a standard answer because all brake pads have a different life span due to lead foot syndrome, pad quality, and environmental conditions.</p><p class="">The average brake life expectancy on a Honda is 30k-50k, some of the Honda drum brakes go well over 100k.  But I have see GM brakes last 15k, and the mechanic says it's normal, really? so as you can see there is no exact formula for brake life expectancy, but in your case, I think you brakes are failing much too fast and you should be getting much more life.</p><p class="">The mechanic has a lot to do with it also because if they don't clean the calipers and lube all the contact points properly, you can have all kinds of problems like squeaks, premature wear, soft brake pedal, and pulsations.</p><p class="">I hope this answers your question Sue, and if you have any more questions, I'll be right here.  Send me some feedback  and let me know how you make out, and don't forget, the squeaky wheel gets the oil :)</p></div></div><hr>

I have a 2009 Chevy Impala LTZ. Lately it's been making a scraping noise and pulling to slow when accelerating from a stop. It does this very infrequently and only my son and I have experienced it. To both of us it sounds and feels like the driver side front. Our mechanic says the brakes are good. It sounds like the noise you hear from the air dam? when pulling too far over a curb.

<div class="comment" id="comment12567338"><div class="author_photo"></div><p class="comment_meta"><strong>Sue Lavalla&nbsp;</strong><span class='timestamp'>20 months ago   </span></p><div class="comment_body"><p class="">Thanks for the response :)</p><p class="">Hubby uses a small local garage - that I absolutely refuse to use again :)  I don't drive even close to 10,000 a year - just around town and ocassionally  a trip 1 1/2 hours away.  So far, I've had to pay for 2 front brake jobs (pads and rotors), 1 back brake job (including drums and wheel cylinder) and a muffler - which didn't even last 9 months so I took it somewhere else to have it replaced.  This was all in less than 3 years   This poor van has seen more than it's worth to spend for OEM parts LOL but gotta at least try to keep it running so have transportation</p><p class="">Brakes aside (for the moment LOL) I've got a bigger and better question(s) for you.  I made the mistake :P of letting hubby take van last night.  He comes home on his break and says "I think your muffler's broken" (mind you, I had the 10 year warranty one put on this time  it was actually lower price than original garage)   I go outside and the car is making ungodly LOUD noise - does sound like when muffler gets hole, but it's definitely in front.  Once I had daylight this morning, I tried to check underneath  Muffler I had put on is fine - as are exhaust pipes.  I tried to check exhaust heat shield up front (lots and lots of potholes here this winter) but couldn't really see too well (I was just in my driveway trying to crawl underneath)  I tried to get in under the hood with my trusty mirror :) but couldn't really see much either</p><p class="">Instead of frustrating myself because I can't get a good view (and driveway is on slant) and to be safe, I decide to go to the gym with  my daughter instead (much better to run on the treadmill to burn off anger and energy than to chase hubby to smack him upside the head LOL)  Forget trying to drive it - won't go above 20</p><p class="">So here's what I'm faced with:</p><p class="">Scares the bejeebers out of me starting it - very loud - almost like a bang at first start up and then,  like I said, does sound like when muffler is going, but it's definitely up front;  Definitely gets louder when drive</p><p class="">Transmission seems stuck - can't get above 20 mph  - no grinding, whirring or whining like it's straining - just won't go anywhere;</p><p class="">Every once in a while, will get a sound like a rattle underneath as well as "clunking" by driver's side wheel</p><p class="">Can't notice any leaks other than small oil one, but in checking plugs in wires, did seem one of the plugs was quite loose and shaking while engine was on</p><p class="">My first thought (and not sure why) was engine seizing for lack of fluid - not enough oil or transmission?   Checked oil and down a little but not much at all.   When I opened oil cap though what a bunch of gunk LOL   Brown sludge looking - almost looked like dirt particles in it.  Hubby says that's what it should look like 'cause it runs through the engine ???</p><p class="">Oh - and best part - I call hubby at work and tell him he didn't tell me car wouldn't drive and his response was "well yeah, it's loosing compression"   but can't tell me why loosing compression (he's still determined it's muffler)</p><p class="">Needless to say, I'm not driving it :(    Any ideas of what to check?  I don't think anything's open around here til Monday anyways, but I like to do my research - I still find garages that try to take advantage and rack up bills figuring a woman doesn't know what's going on</p></div></div><hr>

It sounds like you have a lot more then one issue, I would start by checking the transmission fluid, you said  the vehicle is not moving or it's moves very slow? If the trans fluid is OK, maybe the exhaust leak and low power situation is connected, possibly a clogged catalytic converter?</p><p class="">The rattle under the vehicle is probably a heat shield, the brown gunk is usually caused by lack of maintenance (oil changes). Is the check engine light on? Is there blue smoke coming out the tail pipe?</p></div></div><hr>

But as I can see, you already know that the O2 sensor is faulty? I would have the codes pulled before you go any further, that may be the key to your problem. Keep me posted Sue, thanks :)</p><p class="">Hi Laurie,</p><p class="">It sounds like you have a problem with the traction control system, or possibly a problem with one of the abs sensors. What you're hearing is the ABS system kicking on because the computer thinks one of your wheels is spinning or it has lost traction. I would bring it to the garage and have them check for codes in the traction control or ABS system computer. Let me know what you find out  Laurie, thanks.</p></div></div><hr>

I bought it in May 2012 with 35K miles. I have never done anything with brakes and I'm assuming I have the originals. I haven't had problems up until now.</p><p class="">We had a snow storm last week. I drove that day, no problems. The day after the storm, there was still alot of ice, "crunchy slush" and A LOT of rock salt on the roads. During my drive home from work that night, I started to hear a noise coming from my rear driver side tire. It was a metal scraping metal sound, accompanied by what I can best desribe as a rattle...or a loose piece of metal in the metal on metal mix. A lot of metal noises happening. Ha. Anyway, it didn't seem to have to do with the brakes at first. It didn't matter if I was accelerating, coasting, braking, or turning- the noise was consistent.  Now a week later (although I've only driven 5 days and very short distances to work and home). The noise is the same, but I guess does seem a bit worse when I brake.</p><p class="">Before I found your hub, I convinced myself that there was a piece of salt lodged in my brakes. So I was excited to see that although my problem is probably worse, at least I'm not crazy.</p><p class="">I'm taking it to the shop this week, and prepared to hear that I need new pads and rotors (hopefully not calipers!). But it seems so strange that it happened just like that, with no warning signs, such as squealing. And that it was right after a snow storm.</p><p class="">Is that normal? Do brake problems normally become obvious so suddenly?</p><p class="">Thank you in advance Eddie. -Tina</p></div></div><hr>

I was told the technician said the whole exhaust system from manifold down to tail pipe, as well as the flex, all needed to be replaced ??   I find that a bit hard to believe only because I just had a brand new, 5 year warranty muffler put on about 9-10 months ago - so maybe front of exhaust, but not from muffler down.</p><p class="">I know this shop doesn't like to weld, so I"m wondering if they're thinking it's easier going for whole thing.    The guy I talked to said to check around because that would easily be $800+ there  He also pulled the codes - 2 O2 sensors, a plug and .. shoot if I remember - I'll have to call again maybe</p><p class="">So - it's not catalytic converter (as far as I'm told)  How hard is it to replace the exhaust manifold and O2 sensors?

Changing the manifold is not an easy job and may require some special tools, like a torch.

A couple of issues happening with my car (2008 Scion XB).</p><p class="">Recent history</p><p class="">4/24/13: replace rear disc. brakes</p><p class="">6/13/13: replace rear brake rotors</p><p class="">3/20/14: replace rear disc. brakes</p><p class="">Problem 1</p><p class="">After the April 2013 disc replacement, I experienced a loud pitched noise when highway driving at speeds above 55mph. The noise would go away when I braked or slowed down. Occasionally it would occur at lower speeds when driving around the neighborhood. The noise always stopped when I braked. I took the car to the shop and they replaced the rear rotors. They were unable to replicate the noise. The noise continued throughout the summer. It had been many months since I've heard it UNTIL the disc brakes were replaced AGAIN in March 2014. The noise is back. I also noticed that there is a smell after driving on the highway (which I don't do often -- so it's been noticeable). Is it odd to have replaced the disc brakes after a year? Should I take the car back to the shop? I hate when I go in there with my concerns and they call me later and say they don't hear anything...</p><p class="">Problem 2</p><p class="">Since the disc brake replacement in March 2014, my husband is convinced the car doesn't feel right. The brake pedal feels a little loose. It doesn't go to the floor -- but it feels weird.</p><p class="">Problem 3</p><p class="">Throughout this past miserable winter, my ABS, BRAKE, TC, and VSC lights would go on and off - sometimes staying on for a week or more. This has been a common problem with my Scion during winters (and seems to be common based on my internet searching). Anyway, the lights come on and off now - like 5 minutes on, 2 off, 5 minutes on, etc. Over the past couple of days, when the lights have been OFF, my anti-lock brakes have been acting up on hills and wet pavement -- jerking stops and noise. However, I drove to work today without incident.</p><p class="">Basically I just hope you can give me some ideas of what could be wrong so I can be informed when I go to the shop. Searching for validation!</p><p class="">Thanks ever so!</p></div></div><hr>

I'm not sure why they keep replacing your rotors but it's obvious they don't know what they are doing :)</p><p class="">If you want the mechanic to hear the noise, tell your service advisor you would like to go for a ride with the mechanic so you can point out the noise, it's a common practice in the automotive world. Once you point out the noise to the mechanic, you'll both be on the same page.</p><p class="">Your ABS problem is a little tricky, but it sounds like you have a sensor that is faulty, it should be leaving a temporary diagnostic trouble code in the ABS computer, you mechanic should just check for codes and figure out which sensor it is.</p><p class="">Are you bringing this to the Scion Dealership? If not, you should be. It may cost a few more bucks, but they can probably figure it out a bit quicker. Let me know  Palefeet, thanks</p><p class="">Hi Warren,</p><p class="">You may have heard a rock between the backing plate and rotor, I would just keep an ear on it for now, and if it gets worse, let me know, thanks.</p></div></div><hr>

Its been to the shop 3 x and each time they discover something different, fix the issue and return the car to us. Within days the brakes are just as bad as ever. Im not sure if the mechanic is taking advantage of my lack of knowledge but were closing in on over $1000 spent on repairs and my teenage daughter is in a car I dont feel confident in. HELP!!</p><p class="">First let me say that the problem didn't exist prior to a repair on the brake lines. They rusted through. Both were replaced. After this service, the noise started. Here's a scenario - driving the vehicle at 40 and approach a stop sign. At about 20 mph the brakes start to make a clunking sound and the brake feels as if the car is sliding on ice. I say this because I grew up in the North and it feels exactly like when you brake on a patch of ice and there is a sensation of locking. It continues to make the sound from about 20 mph to a complete stop. Two different garages have seen it. Most recently the mechanic replaced all the sensors? Its a 2003 Jaguar. Any insight would be appreciated. I dont want to continue to pay for unneeded repairs and I desperately want to get to the bottom of this for the safety of my child. Thanks for any help.</p></div></div><hr>

The Jag is a special breed of cars and should be treated as such. It sounds like the ABS is pump is running when you press the brake at or below 20 mph, Why? I'm not sure, but it's either a sensor or a pickup ring. Sorry I can't help any more than that, but I can say that I doubt it has anything to do with the lines being replaced. Let me know if I can help with any other questions, and if you find the problem, could you let me know what it was? Thanks.</p></div></div><hr>

(2002 206 hatchback) it only tends to do it when I'm not braking or steering to the right, and normally only once the brakes have heated up a bit, we cleaned them out a few days ago and it went from a constant squeak to a (More annoying) on off kind of squeak (Like an alarm clock going off) I'm unsure if this is a wear indicator or a stone? Going to go out & check for stones tomorrow afternoon once I get some axle stands but was wondering if you have any input? Thanks</p><p class="">-Harry</p></div></div><hr>

A couple days ago my husband and I switched cars for the day, and while driving his 2005 Hyundai Elantra, I heard the wear indicator on the front left brake, and noticed he needed an oil change. So I took it to Midas where I had them replace the front pads (under warranty, we had their "lifetime" pads for what that is worth) and do the slide/caliper adjustment and the oil change. I did not have the rotors turned as I feel I caught it very early and the rotors were new 40k miles ago. I did not have them service the drums.  They did rotate the tires. Today while driving at highway speeds my husband said the front left wheel started "screeching" and he could feel the vibration through the steering wheel. He said it was very loud and he pulled over.  When he began to drive again, the noise disappeared and hasn't returned so far.  What do you think? Thanks!</p></div></div><hr>

He said they would sound "funny" for a few days but honestly they sound much the same as they did before but the grinding sound isn't quite as loud. Once I've stopped and started going again, the grinding sound continues until I've gained some speed then the sound stops.

I just purchased a 1999 Gmc Yukon. My father was my mechanic, however, we lost him to leukemia on Easter this year so I need help. Here in DE we have to slam our brakes on to ensure each brake is functioning properly and evenly distributed. This is part of our inspection process. Anyway, I went ahead and locked them up as they asked and the truck did perfect. Upon pulling out after inspection I felt a type of "clunk" for lack of a better term. This happens in the rear of the vehicle as the vehicle comes to a complete stop and again as I lift my foot from the brake to accelerate again. Now it doesn't do it all of the time. If I stop very very slowly and I can make it stop. If while I am stopping I ease off the brake and then press back on it as I am slowing to stop I can make it stop. It is almost like the rear drum has a deep groove and the shoe is getting hung up in it, or something broke and is allowing movement, or maybe worse the rear? I know that it isn't the back universal joint. Please help. Thank you in advance for your advice!</p><p class="">Sincerely,</p><p class="">Mike</p></div></div><hr>

If you do, the drums may need to be resurfaced, it's common for the brake shoes  to make a thumping noise on Civics, and it's usually caused by drum surface grooves. Try  pulling up on the e-brake lightly while driving at 30 mph (if you have drum brakes) and see if it makes the noise. Let me know what you find Whitney, thanks.</p></div></div><hr>

It started making a grinding noise while driving and louder when brakes are applied. So I changed brake pads in front where noise was coming from. The ones I replaced were.</p><p class="">not bad and were only six months old.rotary looked good but I went ahead and replaced pads anyway. Noise is still there while I drive and brake. At 60mph steering wheel shakes. I've used noise suppressor in all the right spots. I've also checked the dust cover for touching rotar and no deprive between it and the rotator. Checked all clips nothing rubbing. It kind of feels like caliper might be sticking but not sure because when I pushed them in to install new pads there wasn't any restance</p></div></div><hr>

It's actually sounds like your front rotors are warped so they may need to be resurfaced or replace, depending on how thick your rotors are. If the whole car is shaking when braking, it could be coming from the rear brakes, the front brakes will cause the steering wheel to shake, the rear will cause the car to shake. Hope this helps Kyle, and let me know what you find, thanks.</p><p class="">Hi Rosemary,</p><p class="">I would have the brakes checked asap, it sounds like you have run out of pad material.

For the past three months or so, brakes have been noisy like the rotors have gotten rusty, just recently has gotten much worse.  Brakes still work quite well, stops smoothly, no vibration.  Car has 45,000 km (28,000 miles).  A year ago dealer check showed pads still had 85% left, so can't be worn out.  I took off driver's side wheel, and rotor looked ok, "shiny" and not rusty.  There was a high-pitched intermittent noise earlier in the year - I can't hear it well, so not sure it still makes that noise.  I thought maybe a small bit of rock had gotten stuck in there.  Could it be cause of current problem?  After making a right hand turn with steering fully extended, dragging noise when braking went away briefly, but almost immediately came back.  Is there something stuck in there?  Or something to do with ABS?  Taking car in Thursday.</p></div></div><hr>

I have a 30 day warrenty since I bought it from a dealership so I'm going to take it in on monday but I don't know too much about cars so I decided to try to google what the issue could be and I came across one of your articles. I think one of the issues is one of the wheel bearings is starting to go cuz thats what a friend told me after taking a for a test drive and when I turn my wheel(especially left) it sounds and feels like one or both of the front tires are rubbing against something which is what you talked about in your wheel bearing article. And it gets louder as I speed up, it's at it's loudest on the highway. I also think I may need new brake pads but I'm not completely sure cuz the brakes work for the most part but a couple times when I went to push the break down hard to come to a quick stop the car didn't come to a complete stop,  it kind of slid and it felt like I was driving on a rumble strip. But the brakes work fine if I use them to slow down gradually. So I'm hoping you can let me know if you think I have a wheel bearing and brake issues or if it could be something else. Also can bad wheel bearings affect how the breaks work? Cuz I didn't come across the brake ussue till after I noticed the tire issue. I'm hoping the dealership can fix the issues before my warrenty ends so it doesn't cost me anything cuz I can't really afford to spend much on the car for the next couple months since I just paid for  the whole thing a few weeks ago and I got xmas shopping to do.</p></div></div><hr>

Make sure you road test the vehicle with someone after the repairs to verify the problems are fixed, before you drive off and head home. Some dealerships like to push you off  so they don't have to spend the extra money on the repairs, so be persistent.</p><p class="">I think you're on the right track with the wheel bearing noise. The braking issue sounds more like the ABS is kicking when braking hard, so road test with the tech to point it out.

Is the piston moving when you apply the brakes? Because if the right caliper is doing all the stopping, it will lock up because it not getting any help from the other brake caliper. The rear brakes may need to be adjusted (drum brakes, correct?) If they are out of adjustment your e-brake will not hold and the front brakes would be doing all the stopping (maybe that's another reason the right front caliper is locking up? ). Let me know what you think, thanks Mike.</p></div></div><hr>

One when moving and one when stopped. The one under the hood at idle may be a water pump or a pulley bearing.

The sound is like as something cracking. the sound is heavy but low in intensity.the sound feels like ABS braking but as i said the intensity is low. i have got my brakes checked many times.  The disc pads are ok and rotor seems fine too. the sound sometimes comes and some times it quite. i have a feeling the sound is of disc pads moving back and forth. i also got anti rattle clips tightened. will again get the brakes checked by another mechanic this weekend.   please advise what can this sound be as its very frustrating. i am from Pakistan and i have been to toyota dealership but i am not at all satisfied. the local mechanics are far better than the ones sitting in companies.</p></div></div><hr>

I'm doing well thank you :) The noise you're hearing is probably caused by lack of lubrication on the caliper slide pins, anti rattle clips and pads. Sometimes it helps to resurface the rotors or replace them. The rotors are probably warped a bit causing the calipers to move and creak when braking heavy. Hope this helps Ahmed, and let me know if you have any other questions or you have any feedback on what you found, thanks.</p></div></div><hr>

Brake noises can be annoying, but can also alert us of an upcoming danger. It's best to play it safe and have brake noises checked by a trusted mechanic. I will cover three of the most common brake noises I encounter on a daily basis and try to shed some light on the repair. Some of the repair techniques I share with you here are unorthodox and you will never find them in a service manual or Technical Service Bulletin. If you decide to try them please be cautious and safe. Let\u2019s check out the three most common problems that cause noisy brakes. 1. Grinding Noise When You Apply Your Brakes: A Wake-Up Call Hearing a grinding noise when you apply your brakes is really like hitting a rumble strip on the edge of the highway; if you hear this, you need to wake up and stop driving. A grinding noise on braking is usually caused by a lack of brake pad material; the pads and rotors are now metal to metal, with no braking material left. Brake pads are like bars of soap. Eventually they get used up, and you have to replace them and spend a little money. If you don\u2019t, and your brakes get to the point of grinding, just imagine dollar signs rising into the air every time you step on the brake pedal, even just a little. The grinding noise is just a little voice whispering in your ear saying, \u201dYou\u2019re killing me!\u201d Mechanics have an acronym for this, it\u2019s called CPR (calipers, pads, and rotors). And when you get the bill for your brake job, you will need CPR (cardio-pulmonary rescuscitation). If your brakes are grinding, stop driving and call a tow truck. It\u2019s worth it in the long run. What Happens When You Let That Grinding Noise Go on Too Long insertVideo('YouTube', 'rwMM6hC9xQM', '', 'videoYouTubeBig', '', 'video_618716', ''); You are supposed to replace the pads so they don\u2019t grind your rotors down to a tissue. If you replace your pads on time you can often keep your rotors. Don't Go Cheap on Your Rotors and Pads! They Can Save Your Life! Callahan CFP40390B FRONT Premium Grade OE 282 mm [2] Rotors + [4] Quiet Low Dust Ceramic Brake Pads Kit I have used Callahan rotors and ceramic pads on my kids' cars and on other family members' cars with good results. The quality is almost as good as OEM parts, for a fraction of the price of OEM.&nbsp; Buy Now&nbsp; 2. Thumping Noise From the Rear When Braking This brake issue is one that will annoy the hell out of the driver, and suck the life out of the technician. It took me months to figure out what caused this thumping noise in the rear of a vehicle when braking. After tearing apart the rear of the vehicle, lubing every bushing, and checking the clearances of every part imaginable, I came to the conclusion that it\u2019s the rear drums that cause the noise. Many cars have drum brakes in back, where a shoe stops the car by pressing on the inside of a metal drum. Brake drums, like rotors, get resurfaced once in a while. The cutting bit on the brake lathe removes the old braking surface and leaves a nice new mating surface. During this procedure, the cutting bit will create a groove in the brake drum so slight that the naked eye can\u2019t see it; it\u2019s like a groove on a vinyl record that the needle of the record player follows. When the brake shoes ride on the new surface, they will follow the groove like the needle of your record player follows a track. If the groove is interrupted, the shoes snap back, hitting the backing plate. This phenomenon happens very quickly, causing a thumping noise that will drive you crazy and wondering if your car is falling apart or even safe to drive. There are several ways to fix this noise. One is to replace the rear drums. A second way, less drastic, is to remove the drums, install them on a lathe, and sand the crap out of the mating surface with coarse sandpaper. The third way I found by trial and error and pure frustration is a quick fix using the emergency brake. You will not find this procedure in any service manual or car repair manual, not even on car repair talk radio. It can be dangerous if not performed correctly so please be careful. Nevertheless, I have done it on over 100 cars, including family members\u2019 cars, and I would not recommend it if I thought it damaged the vehicle. How this works is that you get your rear brakes to do 100% of the braking for a few seconds at a time, instead of their usual 30%, and this will cause the brake shoes to polish the grooves out of the drum. For safety reasons, only try this on cars that have an emergency brake handle in the center console; emergency brakes that come up out of the floor can\u2019t be set and released quickly enough. Drive your car in a remote area with little or no traffic at a speed of about 40 miles an hour. Lightly pull up on the emergency brake handle while holding the release button; this is so the emergency brake handle won\u2019t lock in the braking position, and you can release it quickly. Only hold the emergency brake on for about three seconds because you don\u2019t want to overheat the drums. Do this three to five times, while keeping a steady speed; the noise should disappear, or at least be 90% gone. Then drive the car at normal speeds and use the brakes the way you normally would. If the noise has not changed, you may have a different thumping noise than what I have described here in this article. Give up on this remedy and try something else. My sister came to me with this noise after she had her brakes checked at her local garage. They had adjusted her rear brakes so the emergency brake handle had less free play in it, and this is when her troubles began. I took her car out on a test drive for about 10 minutes, performed the procedure described here, and poof, the noise was gone. She was happy because the garage that had caused the noise had no idea how to fix it. 3. \"My Brakes Squeak\" A brake squeak can be very annoying, and furthermore might mean something. It may be a sign of danger of some kind, or it may just be a sign of cheap brake pads. The most common brake squeak is caused by inferior pads. A cheap brake job sounds good when you\u2019re paying for it, but it may come with years of painfully annoying brake squeaks. Cheap brake pads have large metal flakes in the brake material, and when you press the brakes lightly and a flake drags along the rotor, it will squeak. The squeak may go away when that particular flake wears away, but usually there is another metal flake right behind it. The best way to avoid this type of noise is to choose quality brake pads. If your brakes are squeaking or squealing while driving down the road, but the noise goes away when you press on the brakes, I have a hunch that your brake wear indicator is hitting the rotor and causing the noise. The wear indicator is a small metal tab fastened to the brake pad. When the brake pads are worn down and need replacing, this metal tab starts to drag along the rotor, warning the driver of the potential problem. Don\u2019t ignore the noise too long; the brake pads are thin and need servicing very soon, for safety and to protect the other parts of the braking system. Brake pad wear indicator: Metal tab protruding next to pad Source: Eddie Carrara Bonus Noise: Thumping or Squealing Caused by Rotors Rusting Overnight Especially in cars parked outdoors, rust can build up overnight on the rotor around the impression of the pad, causing a thumping or squealing when you drive the car away in the morning. Noises Caused by Rust on Rotors insertVideo('YouTube', 'escgMjdzk6A', '', 'videoYouTubeBig', '', 'video_1030739', ''); A Bonus Noise From the Brake Area I have one other noise I run into a lot that has nothing to do with the brakes themselves\u2014technically, it has to do with rotors\u2014but I thought it was worth mentioning here because it comes from that area, and a lot of customers assume it's their brakes causing the noise. If your vehicle makes a scraping noise, while driving or when turning a corner, that sounds like something being dragged across a tin plate, it's possible you have picked up a rock from a dirt road or from a freshly repaired pothole: the kind of place where you hear a shower of pebbles hitting the bottom of your car as you drive through. There\u2019s a good possibility that a rock has gotten lodged between the rotor and the backing plate, making an awful noise that is causing your ears to bleed. Just have the rock removed and be on your way. Or sometimes the backing plate behind the rotor gets bent while the car is being worked on, and it scrapes against the rotor. A Rock Stuck Next to the Rotor insertVideo('YouTube', 'cGSX8VyhJI8', '', 'videoYouTubeBig', '', 'video_618723', ''); There's an easier way to remove a rock stuck behind the rotor: bend the backing plate a little, as shown in the video below! Scraping Noise From Behind Rotor insertVideo('YouTube', 'HR8UbHpBfmU', '', 'videoYouTubeBig', '', 'video_1011960', ''); I sincerely hope that all the information here will help diagnose that noise that seems to be coming from your brakes. I know that some of my methods are a bit out of the box, but it's what we do sometimes to repair vehicles. There is always a better way, but if you don't try new ideas, you'll never discover it. A wise man once said, \"If you do the same things over and over, expecting different results, you must be crazy.\" For a couple of other common car noises, see the video below. Three Common Car Noises insertVideo('YouTube', 'LYJzFP-QSuY', '', 'videoYouTubeBig', '', 'video_618713', ''); The video above describes squeaking from brake pad wear indicators; a clicking in the front end combined with a shaking steering wheel; and a metallic, knocking noise that happens in the front end while turning.

As a safety precaution, manufactures want to make sure you are stepping on the brakes before you put the transmission in gear, so the gear shift selector has a solenoid that is energized buy stepping on the brake pedal, thus releasing the gear shift lever from it's locked position. So if your car will not come out of park, have someone see if your brake lights are working at the same time the shift lever is stuck, if the brake lights are not working, replace the switch. \nHope this helps, if you have any questions, let me know, take care Gladys."},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christian"},"datePublished":"2012-07-24T19:30:39-07:00","text":"I seem to have an ongoing problem with my 2003 Mazda protege  My car is a stick shift, when getting it up to 3000 rpms into 3rd gear while pressing on the gas my car is fine, accelerating fine, but as soon as i left off the gas petal the car starts to make a sort of thumping or multiple horses galloping sound.

Or was the brake pedal low before all this work was done?\nGravity bleeding is easy but time consuming. First you have to make 4 brake bleeding bottles, clear plastic if possible, like a Gatorade bottle. Drill a hole in the cap, then put a piece of 1\/4'' rubber hose through the hole until the hose reaches the bottom of the bottle,(this is so you can watch the flow of brake fluid from each tube and the air bubbles coming from the tube) make sure the hose inside the bottle is submerged in brake fluid to prevent air from getting in the system vie the hose, leave about a 12'' of hose out the top of the bottle, connect all 4 bottles to the bleeders at each wheel, fill the reservoir, and then open all 4 bleeders , keep an eye on the master cylinder reservoir and top off as needed. Watch all the bleeder hose for the bubbles to stop, once you're confident the air is out of the system, close all bleeders. \nIf you don't know how to adjust rear drum brakes, you can have someone do it for you or you can attempt it yourself.

Remove the plug in the rear of the backing plate and use a drum spoon or brake adjuster spoon to back off the adjuster. Once you have the drums off, you may need to have them resurfaced or replace. This may take care of the thumping noise, I'm not 100% sure, but it might. \nThe thin metal rattle noise is probably caused by the heat shield on the top of the \"B\" pipe, it's very common to have the bolts rust off and cause a rattle noise. I recommend checking all the heat shields on the exhaust, top and bottom of the pipes, not the shields mounted to the bottom of the vehicle. \nLet me know what you find Chris, and if you have other questions or you want to give me more information, I'll be right here :)"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eddie Carrara"},"datePublished":"2013-07-06T05:22:37-07:00","text":"You're welcome usacartitleloans, and thank you for taking the time to comment and read the hub :)"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"the800loanstore"},"datePublished":"2013-07-08T09:23:43-07:00","text":"The brakes are one of those things people try to avoid and \"hold off\" until it's too late.

However, the shoes were tight against the backing plate and not able to move easily.  On the problem wheel, I found two decent sized metal pieces that were lodged in the area where the drum meets the plate.  They had broken off of the drum edge.  I think this what the metal tinging noise that I heard.  I should mention that the noises that I described in my last post changed.  The tinging and thump went away and became a metal scraping sound when I would turn in the direction of the problem wheel and would intensify if I pulled on the emergency brake.  It sounded so bad that I parked the car and stopped driving it for a couple weeks.\n\nWhen I was having trouble removing the drums, I gave in and took it to the shop.  I paid a diagnostic fee for them to tell me that they could hear a lot of noise and that they would replace part after part of the suspension until the problem was resolved.  The estimate was starting at $800 and it said it could cost more.  I was mad because I don't think they even put it on the lift to do a visual inspection and I know they didn't open the drum.

Do both sides and then check your e-brake, it should come up 3-7 clicks.\nWhen ever I replace rear brakes, I'll usually tap off all the rust on the drum with a small hammer, that just prevents chips from breaking off in the future and causing the scraping noise you had.\nIf you ever need any advice or you have more questions Chris, you know where to find me, and if you could push that little Facebook like button to the right for me, that would help me out big time :) Thanks Chris!"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John"},"datePublished":"2013-08-13T04:57:23-07:00","text":"Hi there and firstly what a excellent service you provide mate !!!

What happens is the shoes wears the grease or lube off the backing plate over time at the contact point, then it rust and starts making a squeak noise as you push the brake pedal, it just caused by the brake shoes rubbing on the backing plate with no lube, it's not dangerous, just annoying. \n An easy fix is to remove the drum and lube each contact point on each shoe where it meets the backing plate, or have a rear brake job done by someone who knows what they are doing :) Mention that you have the squeaking noise so they are prepared to lube the contact point when replacing the shoes.

This is a garage where I don't have to worry about the mechanics; they never try to sell a bit of goods you don't need so I think if it turns out to be something else, it won't be a problem. I'm bringing it tomorrow morning. It makes noise whether I'm using brakes or not. Trifle louder when I brake but the brake light hasn't gone on (and when I needed brakes in 2006, believe me, it did!) Wheel bearing, maybe? Or hopefully what you suggested, it would be a relatively easy fix. I drove around to do errands over the weekend- didn't get worse- or better.

I have a 2005 Camry LE (4 cylinder), I had my brake pads replaced around April of 2012, they've been working just fine. But sometimes if I'm driving at a high rate of speed (usually around 60-80mph on the highway) and I have to start braking, I hear this 'whomp\" sound. I'm not sure if that's the most accurate sound to describe but the vehicle doesn't shake or \"chug\" when braking. Also the other day I noticed while driving around town running errands that my brakes again made that whomp whomp whomp sound when braking from 45 mph. I hear the noise in the front of the vehicle, more on the passenger side. I'm not TOO concerned as my brakes work and I think I read somewhere that that's a feature of Toyota when braking from a high speed but I wanted to get your advice. Thanks for your help!

The whomp whomp whomp  noise is probably caused by the drums. \nThe drums start out completely round (New), and over time they become oval because of heat and normal wear. It's nothing to worry about, but when you have your next rear brake job, the mechanic will probably resurface the drums and the nose should subside. \nLet me know if this makes sense to you Amanda, and if you have any other questions or concerns, I'll be right here :)"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"moe19822"},"datePublished":"2013-11-10T08:30:51-08:00","text":"Yes i replaced the axles and just recently changed my brake pads so i know its not something rubbing against anything but i test drove my car and its still sounds like something is rubbing not scraping but rubbing against something when i turn the wheel it makes a rubbing sound \/creaking sound and when i start to accelerate then it goes away so its when i accelerate and SLOWLY turn the wheel "},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eddie Carrara"},"datePublished":"2013-11-10T13:21:05-08:00","text":"Hi Moe, check the wheel well area, turn the wheels to the point where you would normally start to hear the noise and see if your tire is coming close to rubbing on something in the wheel well area like a mudguard or fender well liner.

(PepBoys, Vip) You could try OEM brakes (original equipment) they may last longer with less noise, or you could trade the Caravan in for a Odyssey with far less problems and a better trade in value, lol. Sorry bad joke :)  \nYour question does't have a standard answer because all brake pads have a different life span due to lead foot syndrome, pad quality, and environmental conditions. \nThe average brake life expectancy on a Honda is 30k-50k, some of the Honda drum brakes go well over 100k.  But I have see GM brakes last 15k, and the mechanic says it's normal, really? so as you can see there is no exact formula for brake life expectancy, but in your case, I think you brakes are failing much too fast and you should be getting much more life. \nThe mechanic has a lot to do with it also because if they don't clean the calipers and lube all the contact points properly, you can have all kinds of problems like squeaks, premature wear, soft brake pedal, and pulsations.\nI hope this answers your question Sue, and if you have any more questions, I'll be right here.

So far, I've had to pay for 2 front brake jobs (pads and rotors), 1 back brake job (including drums and wheel cylinder) and a muffler - which didn't even last 9 months so I took it somewhere else to have it replaced.  This was all in less than 3 years   This poor van has seen more than it's worth to spend for OEM parts LOL but gotta at least try to keep it running so have transportation\nBrakes aside (for the moment LOL) I've got a bigger and better question(s) for you.  I made the mistake :P of letting hubby take van last night.  He comes home on his break and says \"I think your muffler's broken\" (mind you, I had the 10 year warranty one put on this time  it was actually lower price than original garage)   I go outside and the car is making ungodly LOUD noise - does sound like when muffler gets hole, but it's definitely in front.  Once I had daylight this morning, I tried to check underneath  Muffler I had put on is fine - as are exhaust pipes.  I tried to check exhaust heat shield up front (lots and lots of potholes here this winter) but couldn't really see too well (I was just in my driveway trying to crawl underneath)  I tried to get in under the hood with my trusty mirror :) but couldn't really see much either\nInstead of frustrating myself because I can't get a good view (and driveway is on slant) and to be safe, I decide to go to the gym with  my daughter instead (much better to run on the treadmill to burn off anger and energy than to chase hubby to smack him upside the head LOL)  Forget trying to drive it - won't go above 20\nSo here's what I'm faced with:\nScares the bejeebers out of me starting it - very loud - almost like a bang at first start up and then,  like I said, does sound like when muffler is going, but it's definitely up front;  Definately gets louder when drive\nTransmission seems stuck - can't get above 20 mph  - no grinding, whirring or whining like it's straining - just won't go anywhere;\nEvery once in a while, will get a sound like a rattle underneath as well as \"clunking\" by driver's side wheel\nCan't notice any leaks other than small oil one, but in checking plugs in wires, did seem one of the plugs was quite loose and shaking while engine was on\nMy first thought (and not sure why) was engine seizing for lack of fluid - not enough oil or transmission?   Checked oil and down a little but not much at all.   When I opened oil cap though what a bunch of gunk LOL   Brown sludge looking - almost looked like dirt particles in it.  Hubby says that's what it should look like 'cause it runs through the engine ???\nOh - and best part - I call hubby at work and tell him he didn't tell me car wouldn't drive and his response was \"well yeah, it's loosing compression\"   but can't tell me why loosing compression (he's still determined it's muffler)\nNeedless to say, I'm not driving it :(    Any ideas of what to check?

I bought it in May 2012 with 35K miles. I have never done anything with brakes and I'm assuming I have the originals. I haven't had problems up until now.\nWe had a snow storm last week. I drove that day, no problems. The day after the storm, there was still alot of ice, \"crunchy slush\" and A LOT of rock salt on the roads. During my drive home from work that night, I started to hear a noise coming from my rear driver side tire. It was a metal scraping metal sound, accompanied by what I can best desribe as a rattle...or a loose peice of metal in the metal on metal mix. A lot of metal noises happening. Ha. Anyway, it didn't seem to have to do with the brakes at first. It didnt matter if I was accelerating, coasting, braking, or turning- the noise was consistent.  Now a week later (although I've only driven 5 days and very short distances to work and home). The noise is the same, but I guess does seem a bit worse when I brake. \nBefore I found your hub, I convinced myself that there was a piece of salt lodged in my brakes.

A couple of issues happening with my car (2008 Scion XB). \n\nRecent history\n4\/24\/13: replace rear disc. brakes \n6\/13\/13: replace rear brake rotors\n3\/20\/14: replace rear disc. brakes\n\nProblem 1\nAfter the April 2013 disc replacement, I experienced a loud pitched noise when highway driving at speeds above 55mph. The noise would go away when I braked or slowed down. Occasionally it would occur at lower speeds when driving around the neighborhood. The noise always stopped when I braked. I took the car to the shop and they replaced the rear rotors. They were unable to replicate the noise. The noise continued throughout the summer. It had been many months since I've heard it UNTIL the disc brakes were replaced AGAIN in March 2014. The noise is back. I also noticed that there is a smell after driving on the highway (which I don't do often -- so it's been noticeable). Is it odd to have replaced the disc brakes after a year? Should I take the car back to the shop? I hate when I go in there with my concerns and they call me later and say they don't hear anything...\n\nProblem 2\nSince the disc brake replacement in March 2014, my husband is convinced the car doesn't feel right. The brake pedal feels a little loose. It doesn't go to the floor -- but it feels weird. \n\nProblem 3\nThroughout this past miserable winter, my ABS, BRAKE, TC, and VSC lights would go on and off - sometimes staying on for a week or more. This has been a common problem with my Scion during winters (and seems to be common based on my internet searching). Anyway, the lights come on and off now - like 5 minutes on, 2 off, 5 minutes on, etc. Over the past couple of days, when the lights have been OFF, my anti-lock brakes have been acting up on hills and wet pavement -- jerking stops and noise. However, I drove to work today without incident. \n\nBasically I just hope you can give me some ideas of what could be wrong so I can be informed when I go to the shop. Searching for validation!\n\nThanks ever so!"},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Warren"},"datePublished":"2014-04-08T07:03:21-07:00","text":"I don't think brakes or rotors have been serviced recently.

Once you point out the noise to the mechanic, you'll both be on the same page. \nYour ABS problem is a little tricky, but it sounds like you have a sensor that is faulty, it should be leaving a temporary diagnostic trouble code in the ABS computer, you mechanic should just check for codes and figure out which sensor it is. \nAre you bringing this to the Scion Dealership?

Heres a scenario - driving the vehicle at 40 and approach a stop sign. At about 20 mph the brakes start to make a clunking sound and the brake feels as if the car is sliding on ice. I say this because I grew up in the North and it feels exactly like when you brake on a patch of ice and there is a sensation of locking. It continues to make the sound from about 20 mph to a complete stop. Two different garages have seen it. Most recently the mechanic replaced all the sensors? Its a 2003 Jaguar.

Anyway, I went ahead and locked them up as they asked and the truck did perfect. Upon pulling out after inspection I felt a type of \"clunk\" for lack of a better term. This happens in the rear of the vehicle as the vehicle comes to a complete stop and again as I lift my foot from the brake to accelerate again. Now it doesn't do it all of the time. If I stop very very slowly and I can make it stop. If while I am stopping I ease off the brake and then press back on it as I am slowing to stop I can make it stop. It is almost like the rear drum has a deep groove and the shoe is getting hung up in it, or something broke and is allowing movement, or maybe worse the rear?

For the past three months or so, brakes have been noisy like the rotors have gotten rusty, just recently has gotten much worse.  Brakes still work quite well, stops smoothly, no vibration.  Car has 45,000 km (28,000 miles).  A year ago dealer check showed pads still had 85% left, so can't be worn out.  I took off driver's side wheel, and rotor looked ok, \"shiny\" and not rusty.  There was a high-pitched intermittent noise earlier in the year - I can't hear it well, so not sure it still makes that noise.  I thought maybe a small bit of rock had gotten stuck in there.  Could it be cause of current problem?  After making a right hand turn with steering fully extended, dragging noise when braking went away briefly, but almost immediately came back.  Is there something stuck in there?  Or something to do with ABS?  Taking car in Thursday.

I know for sure it's nothing to do with your ABS system. If the ABS system was coming on while braking, you would hear a loud grinding type noise and the brake pedal would kick back and be much harder to push.  Let me know what the garage finds, it would be great information for this page, thanks Wayne."},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anna"},"datePublished":"2014-12-18T14:22:16-08:00","text":"Hi!\nI have a 2014 Nissan versa and I have a grinding noise coming from somewhere in the right side of the car.

I have a 30 day warrenty since I bought it from a dealership so I'm going to take it in on monday but I don't know too much about cars so I decided to try to google what the issue could be and I came across one of your articles. I think one of the issues is one of the wheel bearings is starting to go cuz thats what a friend told me after taking a for a test drive and when I turn my wheel(especially left) it sounds and feels like one or both of the front tires are rubbing against something which is what you talked about in your wheel bearing article. And it gets louder as I speed up, it's at it's loudest on the highway. I also think I may need new brake pads but I'm not completly sure cuz the brakes work for the most part but a couple times when I went to push the break down hard to come to a quick stop the car didn't come to a complete stop,  it kind of slid and it felt like I was driving on a rumble strip. But the brakes work fine if I use them to slow down gradually. So I'm hoping you can let me know if you think I have a wheel bearing and brake issues or if it could be something else. Also can bad wheel bearings affect how the breaks work? Cuz I didn't come across the brake ussue till after I noticed the tire issue. I'm hoping the dealership can fix the issues before my warrenty ends so it doesn't cost me anything cuz I can't really afford to spend much on the car for the next couple months since I just paid for  the whole thing a few weeks ago and I got xmas shopping to do.

Make sure you road test the vehicle with someone after the repairs to verify the problems are fixed, before you drive off and head home. Some dealerships like to push you off  so they don't have to spend the extra money on the repairs, so be persistent.  \nI think you're on the right track with the wheel bearing noise. The braking issue sounds more like the ABS is kicking when braking hard, so road test with the tech to point it out. Do you hear a pump running or does the brake pedal kick back when this braking issue happens? Let me know, thanks.

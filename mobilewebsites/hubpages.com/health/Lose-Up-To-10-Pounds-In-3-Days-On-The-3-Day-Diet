<h2 class="subtitle">The Original Three Day Diet Plan</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_38419356"><p>Since I first published the Military Diet diet in 2007, countless people around the world have used it successfully to lose weight. Although there are copycats, this is the original, which is important because even a small change to this diet can set you up for poor results.</p>
<p>How did I come up with all of this?</p>
<p>A military gentleman who attended our church some years back introduced me to this diet. He said that military recruits use this diet when they need to get in shape quickly. Since then I’ve done extensive research and heard from countless people who have tried this plan. Combined with my own personal trial and error, the diet that follows is carefully tested and includes advice to help you succeed. Feel confident and see the results for yourself!</p>
<p>Here's what I'll be covering:</p>
<ul><li>Doctor's Approval for Dieting</li>
<li>The Three Day Diet: Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner</li>
<li>How the Diet Works</li>
<li>Beverages</li>
<li>About the Food Choices</li>
<li>Allowed Additions</li>
<li>Important Information About Substitutions</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Tips to Keep the Weight Off</li>
<li>How to Make the Diet Work for You</li>
<li>Success Stories</li>

If you want to repeat the Military Diet, eat normally for at least four days before doing the three-day diet again.

<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_20557049"><p>Many readers ask whether they should exercise on this diet. The answer is yes! Remember, this diet is used by the military and you don't find those people sitting on their rumps!</p>
<p>The type and duration of exercise you choose depends on your current activity level and how lean you are.</p>
<p>If you are severely overweight, you might choose a brisk walk around the block. That’s great—just keep moving! You may only be able to walk around the block this week, but next week you can try two!</p>
<p>If you are already active and have more muscle, go ahead and push yourself. You'll gain even more muscle and the more muscle you gain, the more you can exercise! You'll look leaner and more toned and will be much healthier in general.</p>
<p>Some great weight-loss exercises include:</p>
<ul><li>jogging</li>
<li>walking briskly</li>
<li>using an elliptical machine</li>
<li>swimming</li>
<li>jumping rope</li>
<li>using a treadmill</li>
</ul><p>Of course it's always wise, and recommended, to discuss your exercise program with a doctor, especially if you have medical/health conditions.</p></div>

<p>However, it doesn't have to be that way. Keep up your good eating habits and stay active and you will keep the weight off.</p>

<li>Take dietary supplements including a good multi-vitamin/mineral supplement. Some other good choices are Omega 3, herbal system cleansers, and food enzymes. (DO NOT take supplements during the three days of the diet unless recommended by a healthcare provider).</li>
<li>Keep up the exercise!</li>
<li>Continue eating nutrition-packed food, although in more variety.</li>

(This is important so that you stay focused and positive.)  </li>
<li>If you repeat the Military Diet, take a four day break between cycles to refuel, refocus, and reset your metabolism.</li>
<li>Take your measurements. If you're gaining muscle, you may not weigh less but you may have lost inches. Toning is great! You will look leaner even with a higher number on the scale if you have toned muscle.</li>
<li>Follow the diet <strong>exactly</strong> for best results.</li>
<li>Exercise! Save your biggest workouts for your days off to save your energy. Exercise lightly on the three days, but be sure to really get moving when you are no longer on the diet.</li>
<li>Get support! Whether it's a family member, weight loss support group, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThreeDayMilitaryDiet">Three Day, Military Diet Facebook page</a>, or the comments section below, reach out if you have questions or need motivation.

<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_38421119"><p>"I'm sure that the Military Diet has saved my life! Let’s be honest: Weighing 332.2 lbs at age 32 isn't much of a life. I was an active person, but still it took a lot of <em>oomph</em> to get me moving and feeling good!</p>
<p>Since I have found and started this meal plan, it has been an amazing adventure! I have dropped weight, increased my activity level, and I feel more confident with myself in everything I do. In March, 2012, while I was still at my highest weight, I completed my first 5K. Then, by walking, doing cardio hip hop, and watching what I ate, I managed to lose 20 pounds. However, when the scale stopped going down I thought I was stuck.</p>
<p>That July, I started this amazing, three-day diet. I told myself that it's only three days, I’ll give it a shot. In the first week, I was down 10 lbs. The weight just kept melting away. I am now down almost 70 lbs. (67.2lbs). I've done this in two months with a few weeks off for vacation and getting back into our school routine. That’s a total of 87.2 lbs since March! I just finished my fifth 5K and have plans of working toward a half marathon! I would have never imagined doing this had I not found this amazing meal plan."</p>
<p><em>Way to go, Becca! We're proud of you. We'll keep watching for your updates of progress. You’re such an inspiration to us all!</em></p></div>

<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_20657617"><p>"I'm a military wife and a mother of three children. Being a military wife is hard, so I found myself turning to food every time I felt sad, worried, or depressed. Because of this, I ballooned to 278 pounds. I was shocked that I had let myself get that unhealthy!</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Military Diet gave me the boost that I needed. In February, 2012, I began following this plan religiously and also combined workouts four times a week. Now, I have managed to lose a total of 80 pounds!</p>
<p>So I say, 'Everything is possible, never give up!'"</p>

<div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_21778293"><p>"Before the birth of my second child, my max weight was 241 pounds. I had gained double the weight with my second pregnancy, but had just accepted the weight gain as being healthy for myself and my baby girl. I was thinking that I would be able to lose it with no problem. Then, at my six week postpartum checkup, I was only down to 216 pounds. I thought to myself, "OK, now that it's been six weeks since my baby was born, I can get back on my exercise routine and lose this weight. No more of those, 'You just had a baby' excuses." Well, I got lazy, and my eating habits didn't change as I thought they would. I would catch myself eating double portions and getting second helpings to the cake, cookies, and all the other "good" stuff.</p>
<p>I was going through some photos on our Ipad one day and I thought to myself, "Oh my . . . who is that lady sitting on our couch?" Looking closer, I realized it was ME! It was heartbreaking that I didn't even recognize myself. My three year old son had candidly taken a picture of me that evening. I'm so glad he did because that was the turning point for me. I had to do something. Only I can change this, right?</p>
<p>One day, as I was browsing on Pinterest, I noticed a link to this article. I was thinking, "WOW! Is this for real? It's probably just another diet that won't work for me." After reading into it further, I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did and that I stayed committed. I never gave up no matter how hungry I was. It changed my life in every way! Now, I don't avoid mirrors anymore. I am getting rid of clothes that are too big, rather than too small. I feel better mentally, physically, and emotionally. I have confidence now that I've never carried with me before! I'm healthier, and just feel better all the way around; more than I have in my entire life! Another thing that makes this experience even better for me is that I just received my lab results from my physician yesterday, and they are better than they have ever been!</p>
<p>I just completed my 15th week and had my weigh-in this morning. I am proud to say that I've reached my weight loss goal of 45 pounds! I am so proud of myself for staying committed to this diet plan and to my exercise routine.</p>
<p>I once read a quote on this diet's Facebook page that has stuck with me ever since: "Life isn't a remote. So get up and change it yourself." That's exactly what I did and I will never regret it.</p>
<p>So now I say to you, 'Stay committed and NEVER give up! This diet does work and will work for you!'"</p>
<p><em>Hooray for Renee! We are all celebrating your success with you!</em></p></div>

You should aim for regular and plain vanilla ice cream.  The small amount of sugar in the ice cream (1/2 cup to 1 cup of ice cream isn't as much as some make it out to be) will help keep you not only from feeling deprived,  but will also keep your sugar levels from bottoming out.  Also,  it contains calcium and other nutrients which is a plus.</p></div></div><hr>

I rated this diet 3 stars, because it works, but may not be the healthiest route for everyone (the bit about asking your doctor should be considered!). It works well for me, and I feel pretty good as long as I keep up the exercise. I am on my second week. I dropped from 222 to 212 after the first 3 day period, and am hoping to get to 198. For my wife, the diet is slower going. She has a harder time keeping the weight off than I do, as her job is less active, and being female it tends to be harder to lose. She is sticking with it with me for now, so we'll see how it goes! I will post an update of our progress next week to further review the results of this diet.</p></div></div><hr>

And, it really wasn't difficult. I wasn't as hungry as I had expected, only was a few times. Most of the time I stayed full for a good 4 hours. I weighed myself each morning (even though you're not supposed to), the morning of the second day I was down 2 lbs, the morning of the 3rd day I was down 5 lbs, and then today I was down 9 lbs. Yay!

If you are snacking in between meals,  adding things that are not approved and are not drinking the daily water requirement of half the body weight in ounces then please, do not complain about results.  Also,  keep in mind that even substitutions may not work the same for everyone.  Also,  the title says Lose "Up to" 10 pounds.  It is not guaranteed that everyone will lose this precise amount.  Everyone is different,  metabolisms are different.  How our bodies respond to food is different.

I couldnt get past the second day. I felt so malnourished, dizzy, and week. I could not concentrate at work.  I did however, lose 8 lbs in the first two days, then continued to lose an additional 6 lbs in the 4 days following, for a total of 14 lbs in 6 days. I am no doctor but maybe the diet jump started my metabolism? I dont know but the weight keeps coming off. While I am not on the diet anymore, I did not exactly go back to old eating habits. The diet helped me realize that I dont need to eat until Im full at every meal and that drinking water wont kill me. I used to just drink energy drinks and/or heavy beer (ales, porters, IPAs). Since the diet I have been drinking a lot more water and limiting my energy drinks and beer consumption to one each per day and since I am not eating until I am full at every meal, the weight keeps coming off.</p></div></div><hr>

On my four days off, I only regained 1.8 pounds.  During that time, I continued drinking water.  I ate whatever I wanted.  I ate chili cheese hotdogs, tater tots with cheese, chili relleno with rice and beans, thin crust cheese pizza, ice cream, and better food choices like fruit, salads, veggies, baked chicken, etc.  I didn't worry about whether or not I should be eating it, I just made sure I didn't overeat.  I started another three days today.  I can't wait to get on the scales Thursday to see how I've done.  I'm so glad blessedmommy posted the Military Diet online.  I've shared this website with several family members and friends.  I can't wait to see how well they do!</p></div></div><hr>

Although there are copycats, this is the original, which is important because even a small change to this diet can set you up for poor results. How did I come up with all of this? A military gentleman who attended our church some years back introduced me to this diet. He said that military recruits use this diet when they need to get in shape quickly. Since then I\u2019ve done extensive research and heard from countless people who have tried this plan. Combined with my own personal trial and error, the diet that follows is carefully tested and includes advice to help you succeed. Feel confident and see the results for yourself! Here's what I'll be covering: Doctor's Approval for Dieting The Three Day Diet: Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner How the Diet Works Beverages About the Food Choices Allowed Additions Important Information About Substitutions Exercise Tips to Keep the Weight Off How to Make the Diet Work for You Success Stories Doctor Approval for Dieting Before starting this or any diet, check with your doctor. Read on for facts and information, but whether this diet is right for you is up to you and your physician. Three Day Military Diet: Day One Breakfast Day One Breakfast 1\/2 grapefruit 1 slice toast 2 tablespoons peanut butter coffee or tea (any brew, as long as it's caffeinated) Lunch Day One Lunch 1\/2 cup tuna 1 slice toast coffee or tea Dinner Day One Dinner 3 ounces meat (any type) 1 cup green beans 1\/2 banana 1 small apple 1 cup vanilla ice cream Tips to Make Dinner Delicious Cook the green beans with the meat or simmer in broth. Warm the apple and\/or banana and pour over the ice cream. Yum! Three Day Military Diet: Day Two Breakfast Day Two Breakfast 1 egg 1 slice toast 1\/2 banana Lunch Day Two Lunch 1 cup cottage cheese (or 1 slice cheddar cheese) 1 hardboiled egg 5 saltine crackers Dinner Day Two Dinner 2 hot dogs (no buns) 1 cup broccoli 1\/2 cup carrots 1\/2 banana 1\/2 cup of vanilla ice cream Three Day Military Diet: Day Three Breakfast Day Three Breakfast 5 saltine crackers 1 slice cheddar cheese 1 small apple Lunch Day Three Lunch 1 hardboiled egg 1 slice toast Dinner Day Three Dinner 1 cup tuna 1\/2 banana 1 cup vanilla ice cream How the Military Diet Works The foods on the menu work together to boost metabolism, provide energy, help with sugar swings, and jump-start the fat-burning process. The diet must be followed for three consecutive days. In three days you should lose up to 10 pounds. After three days, eat as you normally do, but don\u2019t over-do it! If you want to repeat the Military Diet, eat normally for at least four days before doing the three-day diet again. You could lose up to 40 pounds in a month if you follow these guidelines precisely. No snacking between meals! Approved Beverages Caffeinated coffee or black tea for the first two meals of day one only. No added sugar or milk. Water only from then on. Here is what to aim for: Take half of your weight in pounds and drink at least that many ounces of water. For example, if you weigh 160 pounds, drink at least 80 ounces of water per day (more if you exercise vigorously). About the Military Diet Food Choices Toast: You may use any type of bread but whole wheat is preferred. Eat it either toasted or not. Peanut butter: Crunchy or smooth. Choose a brand without added sugar. Tuna: Fresh or canned. Slice of cheddar: About two ounces. Meat: May be any type, including (but not limited to) seafood, beef, pork, or poultry. If using canned or deli meat, look for low-sodium. Vanilla ice cream: Plain, nothing added. Egg: Where not specified, the egg can be cooked in any manner. Saltine crackers: Plain soda crackers. If not available, use plain crackers. Hot dogs: Beef or turkey franks. Avoid mixed-meat wieners with fillers. Allowed Additions Splenda Small amounts of mustard Small amounts of relish Lemon pepper Sugar-free gum and mints Salt and pepper but no other seasoning Important Information About Food Substitutions Five ounces of a meal replacement shake or two ounces of low-fat yogurt with 1\/2 teaspoon flax seed can be substituted for a slice of toast. The foods recommended for this diet work together to boost metabolism, so it is not recommended that you substitute any foods. The results are not guaranteed and the diet may not work if not followed precisely. If you must find an alternative to a food on the diet for a health or medical reason, here are the best choices with the same nutritional value. Toast Substitution Choices 1 ounce (1\/8 cup) sunflower kernels (sunflower seeds are gluten-free. If you are avoiding gluten, don\u2019t choose the Planters brand which has traces of gluten.) 1\/2 of a high protein nutrition bar 2 ounces (1\/4 cup) low-fat yogurt with 1\/2 teaspoon flax seed 1\/2 cup of unsweetened whole grain cereal (such as Kashi Go Lean) 5 ounces of a meal replacement shake Grapefruit Substitute 1\/2 teaspoon baking soda in a glass of water can be substituted for grapefruit. Allow the mixture to sit for at least 30 minutes before drinking. Eat another piece of fruit in place of the grapefruit with your meal. Banana Substitute Choices 2 kiwi (1\/2 banana = 1 kiwi) 1 cup papaya 2 apricots Peanut Butter Substitute Choices soy butter sunflower seed butter same measurement of sunflower kernels The same measurement of cottage cheese can be substituted for tuna. Tuna Substitute Choices cottage cheese cooked chicken tofu almonds flax seeds pumpkin seeds peanuts Hot Dog Substitute Choices veggie dogs bratwurst any type of beans or lentils (4 ounces per frank) Apple Substitute Choices Any other \"fleshy\" type fruit, including plums, peaches, or grapes. Substitute two slices of bacon for cooked egg. Egg Substitute Choices 1 cup milk 1 chicken wing 1\/4 cup seeds or nuts 2 slices bacon Vanilla Ice Cream Substitute Choices strawberry or vanilla flavored milk (not chocolate) low-fat yogurt with a small amount of fruit apple juice Substitute three cups of fresh (or one cup cooked and drained) spinach for green beans. Green Beans Substitute Choices lettuce and a few cherry tomatoes tomatoes (same measurement as beans) 3 cups raw spinach or one cup cooked and drained Carrot Substitute Choices 2 cups raw (or 1\/2 cup cooked and drained) spinach beets (same measurements as carrots) 1 whole bell pepper small salad of 1 cup fresh spinach, 1\/4 bell pepper, and a few cherry tomatoes (may include salt, pepper, mustard, lemon pepper, or lemon juice for dressing) Cheddar Cheese Substitute Choices cottage cheese (1 cup = 1 slice) 2 eggs 2 ounces ham Broccoli Substitute Choices cauliflower beets asparagus brussel sprouts Substitute two ounces cheddar cheese for one cup of cottage cheese. Cottage Cheese Substitute Choices 2 ounces cheddar cheese (for 1 cup cottage cheese) 2 eggs 2 ounces ham Coffee or Tea Substitute Choices sugar free hot chocolate made with hot water, not milk Exercise Too? Yes! Many readers ask whether they should exercise on this diet. The answer is yes! Remember, this diet is used by the military and you don't find those people sitting on their rumps! The type and duration of exercise you choose depends on your current activity level and how lean you are. If you are severely overweight, you might choose a brisk walk around the block. That\u2019s great\u2014just keep moving! You may only be able to walk around the block this week, but next week you can try two! If you are already active and have more muscle, go ahead and push yourself. You'll gain even more muscle and the more muscle you gain, the more you can exercise! You'll look leaner and more toned and will be much healthier in general. Some great weight-loss exercises include: jogging walking briskly using an elliptical machine swimming jumping rope using a treadmill Of course it's always wise, and recommended, to discuss your exercise program with a doctor, especially if you have medical\/health conditions. I'm Afraid I'll Gain It All Back! Whether you repeat the Military Diet after four days off or not, gaining the weight back is a concern. If you eat cheesecake and candy bars instead of fruit, you may indeed gain it back! However, it doesn't have to be that way. Keep up your good eating habits and stay active and you will keep the weight off. For help staying focused, I suggest this free service: My Fitness Pal. This online tool can be used with a computer or mobile device to help you keep track of what you eat. It's easy and will help you stay on track. You can keep track of exercise, too. Tips to Keep the Weight Off Take half of your weight (in pounds) and drink at least that many ounces of water every day. Continue to drink your water as before. Here\u2019s what to aim for: Take half of your weight (in pounds) and drink at least that many ounces of water. For example if you weigh 160 pounds, drink at least 80 ounces of water per day (more if you exercise vigorously). Take dietary supplements including a good multi-vitamin\/mineral supplement. Some other good choices are Omega 3, herbal system cleansers, and food enzymes. (DO NOT take supplements during the three days of the diet unless recommended by a healthcare provider). Keep up the exercise! Continue eating nutrition-packed food, although in more variety. If you plan to continue the Military Diet, use your four days off to refocus and prepare for the three days back on by shopping, cooking ahead of time, and ridding the house of tempting foods. How to Make the Military Diet Work for You Weigh yourself on the morning of the first day but not again until the morning of the fourth day, because weight can fluctuate unpredictably and make you discouraged. (This is important so that you stay focused and positive.) If you repeat the Military Diet, take a four day break between cycles to refuel, refocus, and reset your metabolism. Take your measurements. If you're gaining muscle, you may not weigh less but you may have lost inches. Toning is great! You will look leaner even with a higher number on the scale if you have toned muscle. Follow the diet exactly for best results. Exercise! Save your biggest workouts for your days off to save your energy. Exercise lightly on the three days, but be sure to really get moving when you are no longer on the diet. Get support! Whether it's a family member, weight loss support group, the Three Day, Military Diet Facebook page, or the comments section below, reach out if you have questions or need motivation. Also, return the favor to others. You may be the one that gives someone the exact words they need to succeed! Success Story Showcase These are people just like you who found success using the Military Diet. I'm sure that the stories featured here will inspire and motivate you to achieve your own goals. Becca: Salem, Oregon Becca lost 87.2 pounds through diet and exercise. \"I'm sure that the Military Diet has saved my life! Let\u2019s be honest: Weighing 332.2 lbs at age 32 isn't much of a life. I was an active person, but still it took a lot of oomph to get me moving and feeling good! Since I have found and started this meal plan, it has been an amazing adventure! I have dropped weight, increased my activity level, and I feel more confident with myself in everything I do. In March, 2012, while I was still at my highest weight, I completed my first 5K. Then, by walking, doing cardio hip hop, and watching what I ate, I managed to lose 20 pounds. However, when the scale stopped going down I thought I was stuck. That July, I started this amazing, three-day diet. I told myself that it's only three days, I\u2019ll give it a shot. In the first week, I was down 10 lbs. The weight just kept melting away. I am now down almost 70 lbs. (67.2lbs). I've done this in two months with a few weeks off for vacation and getting back into our school routine. That\u2019s a total of 87.2 lbs since March! I just finished my fifth 5K and have plans of working toward a half marathon! I would have never imagined doing this had I not found this amazing meal plan.\" Way to go, Becca! We're proud of you. We'll keep watching for your updates of progress. You\u2019re such an inspiration to us all! Perla: Colorado Springs, Colorado Perla lost 80 pounds through diet and regular workouts. \"I'm a military wife and a mother of three children. Being a military wife is hard, so I found myself turning to food every time I felt sad, worried, or depressed. Because of this, I ballooned to 278 pounds. I was shocked that I had let myself get that unhealthy! Thankfully, the Military Diet gave me the boost that I needed. In February, 2012, I began following this plan religiously and also combined workouts four times a week. Now, I have managed to lose a total of 80 pounds! So I say, 'Everything is possible, never give up!'\" Congratulations, Perla! Your experience is an inspiration! Renee: Grain Valley, Missouri \"Before the birth of my second child, my max weight was 241 pounds. I had gained double the weight with my second pregnancy, but had just accepted the weight gain as being healthy for myself and my baby girl. I was thinking that I would be able to lose it with no problem. Then, at my six week postpartum checkup, I was only down to 216 pounds. I thought to myself, \"OK, now that it's been six weeks since my baby was born, I can get back on my exercise routine and lose this weight. No more of those, 'You just had a baby' excuses.\" Well, I got lazy, and my eating habits didn't change as I thought they would. I would catch myself eating double portions and getting second helpings to the cake, cookies, and all the other \"good\" stuff. I was going through some photos on our Ipad one day and I thought to myself, \"Oh my . . . who is that lady sitting on our couch?\" Looking closer, I realized it was ME! It was heartbreaking that I didn't even recognize myself. My three year old son had candidly taken a picture of me that evening. I'm so glad he did because that was the turning point for me. I had to do something. Only I can change this, right? One day, as I was browsing on Pinterest, I noticed a link to this article. I was thinking, \"WOW! Is this for real? It's probably just another diet that won't work for me.\" After reading into it further, I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did and that I stayed committed. I never gave up no matter how hungry I was. It changed my life in every way! Now, I don't avoid mirrors anymore. I am getting rid of clothes that are too big, rather than too small. I feel better mentally, physically, and emotionally. I have confidence now that I've never carried with me before! I'm healthier, and just feel better all the way around; more than I have in my entire life! Another thing that makes this experience even better for me is that I just received my lab results from my physician yesterday, and they are better than they have ever been! I just completed my 15th week and had my weigh-in this morning. I am proud to say that I've reached my weight loss goal of 45 pounds! I am so proud of myself for staying committed to this diet plan and to my exercise routine. I once read a quote on this diet's Facebook page that has stuck with me ever since: \"Life isn't a remote. So get up and change it yourself.\" That's exactly what I did and I will never regret it. So now I say to you, 'Stay committed and NEVER give up! This diet does work and will work for you!'\" Hooray for Renee! We are all celebrating your success with you! Please Share!

You should aim for regular and plain vanilla ice cream.  The small amount of sugar in the ice cream (1\/2 cup to 1 cup of ice cream isn't as much as some make it out to be) will help keep you not only from feeling deprived,  but will also keep your sugar levels from bottoming out.  Also,  it contains calcium and other nutrients which is a plus."},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeannette"},"datePublished":"2015-05-05T17:29:12-07:00","text":"I'm on the end of the 2nd day of this diet.

I rated this diet 3 stars, because it works, but may not be the healthiest route for everyone (the bit about asking your doctor should be considered!). It works well for me, and I feel pretty good as long as I keep up the exercise. I am on my second week. I dropped from 222 to 212 after the first 3 day period, and am hoping to get to 198. For my wife, the diet is slower going. She has a harder time keeping the weight off than I do, as her job is less active, and being female it tends to be harder to lose. She is sticking with it with me for now, so we'll see how it goes! I will post an update of our progress next week to further review the results of this diet.

If you are snacking in between meals,  adding things that are not approved and are not drinking the daily water requirement of half the body weight in ounces then please, do not complain about results.  Also,  keep in mind that even substitutions may not work the same for everyone.  Also,  the title says Lose \"Up to\" 10 pounds.  It is not guaranteed that everyone will lose this precise amount.  Everyone is different,  metabolisms are different.  How our bodies respond to food is different.

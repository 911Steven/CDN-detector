<h2 class="subtitle">Neglected Wife Symptoms—Ways Husbands Destroy Their Marriages</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298584"><p>It is important to remember that the main goal of marriage should be peace and happiness. So, while this list below may seen daunting, always remember that. If life is stressful, then work on changing your perception. You can see peace instead of stress. You are only one thought away from a peaceful life. If you feel unhappy, seek the things that will fulfill you in life. Just be happy. The simplest route to something is to just be. The only person you can change is yourself.</p>
<p>Also, while both the husband and wife should take responsibility for their part in a marriage, below are ten mistakes common to men. Read on to learn about the behaviors of men which can completely destroy a marriage.</p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">1. Leaving Her Alone</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_7528774"><p>One of the quickest ways to destroy your marriage is to leave your wife alone. This means things like spending long hours at work and following it up by a beer or several afterward with the guys. Then, when you get home, you don't engage her or your children. Instead, you lose yourself in baseball or computer poker. Also, on the weekends, you'll complain about the messy house, then leave to run errands, and then you don't come back for several hours.</p>
<p>One of the most most miserable experiences for a wife is that feeling of isolation when her husband emotionally leaves the relationship. Yes, she has friends and a job. Yes, she spends a lot of time running the kids around and partaking in activities outside of her husband. It's not the same. Her desire is to spend time with you, the man she loves. To be left alone by her husband causes deep heartache for women. For most women, their largest fears boil down to isolation and deprivation. When she feels abandoned by you, she attacks with hurtful and disrespectful behavior. Her ability to verbally hurt you is her strongest weapon, and she uses it out of fear in an effort to try to get your attention.</p>
<p>When a wife begins to nag because you never spend time at home, never hang out with her, and never engage with the kids, chances are she is feeling abandoned and isolated. When you stop spending time together, the emotional distance between you two grows quickly.</p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">2. Not Getting Close Enough</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298614"><p>Your wife feels energized when she feels close to you. Refusing to let her know you is destructive to her and your marriage. While you strive to keep your independence, she longs to connect with you. It is not fair to either of you if you are only affectionate and attentive on the days you want sex or something from her. Affection and closeness ought to be an end in themselves, not a means to a different end.</p>
<p>Talking is not the only way women feel close, although it is an important one. Simple ways to fulfill your wife in this area are to hug her often, hold her hand, and to spend some time alone with her. When her need for closeness is met, she will be more inclined to respect your need for independence. When your wife feels close to you, she will also be more willing to engage with you on a more intimate, sexual level.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is to help her feel connected. Try talking to her about your day, your fears, hopes, and dreams. Hold her hand when you go out together. Kiss her unexpectedly in the kitchen while she makes dinner. Sit next to her. Ask her how she is doing, and for a few minutes, give her your undivided attention while she answers. A little bit will go a long way and mean everything to her and, in turn, your marriage.</p></div>

<div id="mod_39298618" class="module moduleText color0">
<h2 class="subtitle">2.5. Closing Yourself Off to Her </h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298618"><p>Women exist as an integrated circuit. The mind, body, and soul are closely linked — so, hurt feelings affect the entire system. A wife whose spirit is crushed may suffer from fatigue and confusion. Like a strand of Christmas lights — when one light goes out, they all go dark. Men compartmentalize. If one light goes out on his strand, all the other lights function properly, unaffected. Men are able to fully function when one area of their lives is not working properly.</p>
<p>Your wife does not understand the closed-off and mysterious way you operate. Things don't seem to bother you. You never want to talk to her. She knows you are stressed about work, yet you don't show it or express that further to her. She wonders how you can even function. Your wife is not trying to pry or sneak her way into no-man's land. She simply wants you to be open. She wants to truly <em>see</em> you. She feels loved when you share your fears, worries, and troubles. She wants to be that person for you and committed to being so when you got married. She won't try to fix you. She will listen.</p>
<p>Try talking to her about what is going on in your life. Women like to vent, without seeking a solution, and she wants to give you the freedom to share yourself verbally.</p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">3. Always Trying to "Fix" Her</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298624"><p>Even when she doesn't always say it, your wife sees you as her strength. As the bearer of her burdens. When she comes to you for help to lighten the load from the weight of her world, it is a compliment. She knows you can handle it.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to resolve and repair every issue, however, try to just listen to her. You might even ask if she needs a solution or just an ear. It will be a relief for both of you when you realize that sometimes you don't have to fix all the problems. Furthermore, when you listen, she will feel like you understand her (even if you don't, which is okay).</p></div>
</div>
<div id="mod_39298634" class="module moduleText color0">
<h2 class="subtitle">4. Never Saying "I'm Sorry."</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298634"><p>All marriages have conflict. The refusal to apologize is a quick way to destroy yours. While conflict is not a pleasant thing, growth and closeness can increase as conflict is resolved. For your wife, an apology means she has moved forward through the conflict, and she is now seeking peace.</p>
<p>Many husbands see apologizing as a sure sign of weakness. They think, "If I apologize, she won't respect me." On the contrary, if you humbly apologize and ask her forgiveness, your wife will be putty in your hands. Your small act of contrition soothes her spirit, and acts as a healing balm over her heart. Furthermore, it shows that you're open and willing to make things work, that you care enough to admit to your faults and move past and through them. </p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">5. Taking Her Insecurities Too Lightly</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298635"><p>Your wife knows she is highly committed to you. When she sees you looking at other women, in the mall, on TV, on the computer, and in other places, she fears that you may be unfaithful and at the very least, it may make her uncomfortable and question your attraction to them, especially if she is solely just looking at you. Regardless, she is insecure and needs your reassurance, not any belittling, joking, or teasing. These activities all devalues her feelings, which are real. When you stare at a cute young thing as she saunters by, it may be a reminder to your wife of her many imperfections. She feels insecure because she wants to know that you still love her and you looking at other women may not be so reassuring of that. It's okay for you to look at other women, in fact, it's perfectly natural. The danger is when you are blatant and aggressive, disregarding your wife's feelings and staring in spite of her discomfort.</p>
<p>Your wife is motivated by your love and loyalty. She has committed her life to you, and wants to feel secure in the fact that you are equally committed to her. A big symbol of your loyalty to your wife is a wedding ring. For a woman, this is a sign of your fidelity. A married man without a ring seems to be trying to hide something. This requires very little effort, if any, on your part to reassure your wife in this way, and yet it would mean the world to her. Her peace of mind ought to be worth the cost of an inexpensive, outward expression of your fidelity. You have nothing to hide. A ring is a simple, outward expression of your devotion to your wife and to your marriage. This small gesture can have deep impact.</p>
<p>When your wife feels insecure, she may ask if you still think she is pretty. She may ask if you love her. She may ask if you think someone else is more attractive. This is not a trap. She feels she is moving toward you, by asking a question and starting a conversation. Talking is how women feel close. She is seeking your assurance of love and loyalty. Rather than make light of the moment, look at her. No, really look at her. Tell her she is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. Give her the assurance she seeks, and ease her troubled mind. </p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">6. Ignoring the Importance of Simple Gestures</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_21340092"><p>Your wife does not require fancy jewelry or expensive meals. Granted, those things are nice, and you like to treat your wife. However, it isn't always necessary.</p>
<p>She feels most loved by the small tokens of your love and appreciation. When you neglect the small things, it may feel to her like you are trying to buy her affection — or ease your own guilt — with the big things. Let your wife know that she is on your mind during the day. A single rose when you walk in the door speaks volumes to her language of love. Give her a call or send her a text during the day to let her know you are thinking of her. Offer to help with dinner, or wash the dishes. These are small gifts of your time that mean the world to your wife.</p>
<p>For your wife, the most important days of the year are her birthday and the day she married you. Celebrate these days by spending time with just her. It will mean more than any expensive gift ever could. The cost of the gift is secondary to the thought you put into it. She wants to feel special and important to you. The way to help her feel loved is to spend time with her alone. Even if you sit home and watch a movie, give her your undivided attention.</p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">7. Taking All the Fun Out of Sex</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298638"><p>When you confuse sex with intimacy, it's no fun. When you only focus on your own orgasm, it's no fun. When you only show interest in your wife when you want to get lucky, it's no fun. When you devalue the depth of your sexual relationship with crude jokes and pornography, it's no fun. When you expect her to get excited instantly, it's no fun. When you neglect your wife's sexual needs, it's no fun.</p>
<p>When you are married, sex is supposed to be fun.</p>
<p>An intimate sharing, designed to bring you closer, sex should cement the bond between you. For example, think of your wife as a crockpot. Meanwhile, in this comparison, you are a microwave. Put a meal in a microwave, and you are eating within three minutes. A crockpot meal takes a lot of forethought. You need the proper ingredients. You have to put everything together, turn it on, and wait. Six or eight hours later, you enjoy a delicious meal. Your wife needs the same thoughtful consideration. Start in the morning with a kiss. Tell her she's beautiful. Women never get tired of hearing that from the man they love. Help get the kids ready for school. After work, ask about her day.</p>
<p>Slow, slow, slow. If you want to bring the fun back into sex, think crockpot, not microwave. You can microwave in the shower (not literally, obviously). </p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">8. Getting Lost in Bitterness and Anger</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298639"><p>When you shut your wife out to brood in your despair, it fills her with fear. Women like to talk things out. Men like to shut things out. When you feel stressed about work, about money, about your relationship, you turn inward. This provokes your wife's fear of abandonment and rejection.</p>
<p>She thinks you don't love her when you refuse to speak. This fear, and her desire to resolve conflict, cause your wife to pursue you. She wants to talk it out, not to belittle or demean you, but to feel closer. She wants you to trust her, so she can trust you. She follows you around, asking if everything is alright. You run away from her and avoid wanting to discuss what is bothering you. She knows something is wrong, and she begins to assume that she is the problem.</p>
<p>You can stop this train wreck before it happens by opening up to your wife. She loves you. You can trust her. Share your real feelings with her, and she will open her heart to you.</p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">9. Not Taking Responsibility </h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298640"><p>Whether it's an addiction, an affair or poor performance in your life, many times, husbands point to their wives as the reason for their weakness. "She makes me drink because of her nagging. I cheated because she wouldn't take care of me. I'm doing poorly because she never encourages me."</p>
<p>It's time to take full responsibility for your own behavior. You need to take ownership of your actions. You choose to drink. You choose to cheat. You choose to work or not work. You actively do all these things on your own. Rather than blaming someone or something else, stand up and take control. Make your life reflect the values you desire. Your life is completely under your control. Today, you can choose differently. You can create exactly the life you want. Furthermore, if your wife really is the root of all the problems in your life, then take control of that as well and man up and tell her the truth. She can't change if you aren't willing to express the problem.</p></div>

<h2 class="subtitle">10. Picking the Wrong Woman. Again. </h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39298641"><p>A woman in distress, who just moves from crisis to crisis, will continue to be in distress after you marry her. A nitpicking woman who criticizes your every decision will continue to nitpick. A control freak always wants control, even after the wedding. The bottom line is: if she is the wrong woman before the marriage, she'll be the wrong woman when and after you get married. </p>
<p>If you want a nice wife, then date a nice woman and marry her. Treat her with love and respect and she will return the kindness. Trying to rescue a woman in distress will only lead you to feel used and unappreciated. A strong marriage begins with a good-willed woman and a good-willed man. It flourishes as you both grow in love and respect toward each other.</p>
<p>Choosing the wrong woman sets you up for failure every time. Although you might like the feeling of being a knight in shining armor rescuing a damsel in distress, the reality of being married is much harder and much less idealistic. Marriage takes work, from both the husband and the wife. When both are committed to making the marriage a good experience, then it has a better chance of succeeding.</p></div>

<div id="mod_39368401" class="module moduleText color0">
<h2 class="subtitle">Work on Yourself</h2><div style="" class="txtd" id="txtd_39368401"><p>While this list may seem daunting, it is important to remember that the main goal of marriage should be peace and happiness. If life is stressful, work on changing your perception. You can see peace instead of stress. You are only one thought away from a peaceful life. If you feel unhappy, seek those thing that will fulfill you in life. Just be happy. The simplest route to something is to just be. The only person you can change is yourself.</p></div>

As a man who's been happily married for over 40 years, I've got a fair understanding of the trials and triumphs that marriage entails. But the part of your piece that made me pause, was your comment about not wearing a wedding ring. On our wedding day, when my wife put her ring on my finger, I felt incredibly blessed and proud; and apart from a couple of times when medical procedures have required it, I've worn it every day since. My wife has an interesting view on it. She's always said that, instead of "sisters doing it for themselves", too many sisters are doing it TO themselves, and that for some, a man's wedding ring represents both an opportunity (if he can be tempted), and a challenge (if he hasn't yet been). To me, it's always been a badge of fidelity, but I've nevertheless had my share of encounters which add credibility to my wife's observation. (When I was younger...lol).</p></div></div><hr>

I am not a religious nut, in fact don't even go to church, however it is beautiful in its simplicity.  It holds the man not entitled but responsible for the care of the marriage and the woman.</p><p class="">I know many many men who "pick" the right woman only to treat her so horribly, and become competitive, and out to win by domination, subjugation, over control (while not applying their rules of engagement to themselves), jealousy (of her mother, father, friends, and yep, their children, her hobbies well, you name it) as they have been wrongly told this is how you keep a woman and be a man.</p><p class="">I have heard men joke, belittle women, objectify them, and brag about their lies to women.  I have seen men put everything and everyone first on their list but the wife and her "needs" or those of the family as important at all, and just  assign those things as the wife's responsibility. They joke and laugh and lie their way out of all home-based responsibility.  Who think because they may work outside the home, they are entitled to be free from ANY and ALL responsibilities IN the home.</p><p class="">Then they actually think they can come home and do the right thing by the wife. Or over time they  become obsessed with how "manly" they are to keep the little woman in line.</p><p class="">They  are so egotistical they cannot hear one thing about themselves that isn't totally positive, and they expect those positive strokes while totally downgrading  wife, and her feminine constantly. They rarely, if ever sincerely show any appreciation for the wife, and less, if she doesn't work outside the home.</p><p class="">These are frequently the same men that blame the failure of the marriage on the woman, and continue to further tell anyone and everyone who they can or will listen to them how the marriage failure was all her fault, and bemoan how SHE got the house, kids and all their money in the divorce.</p><p class="">Of course, they never realize that HE was rarely IN that house, nor did he take any interest in fixing, maintaining, or putting of his money into the house, and or  rarely spent any time with those CHILDREN, and failed to understand or care how many times he told her it was his MONEY, or how he withheld it from his family to be in control.</p></div></div><hr>

He is about to be an ex, and yet he STILL thinks it is my job to see to his needs, calls himself a victim and yes, bemoans how unfair this all is.

A man is supposed to listen to a woman's fears and make her  feel secure, That's good as long as it doesn't get to ne her only way ti handle problems and she still continues to grow as an adult. Now tirn that around. How can someone who os usually looking to have her fears mollified be of any help when her savior has fears? SHE CAN'T.  What she will usually do is get even MORE afraid than him and start asking him to make her feel better which makes ot worse foe him. This is pretty universal among women of child bearing age. It's a falsehood that a man kind find much support in his darkest hours from most women he might marry. (So glad that I choose carefully now) This cultural lie is also why most men can identify woth Jack Nicholson's character in 'As Good as it Gets' when he describes how he understood women to write love novels for them.</p></div></div><hr>

I'd like to respectfully disagree with your assessment.  Peace and happiness come from entering in the earthly Covenant of Marriage to provide a stable home for children to grow.  We are charged to rear godly offspring for His Glory.  Leading a Christian life and living a Marriage for God provides the happiness and peace you speak of which are not the goals.</p></div></div><hr>

Men speak in Black and White, we speak in body language. Learn to speak his language and don't expect him to know yours.

I was home from work for half an hour yesterday before he even realized and acknowledged that I was home. The worst part is....he thinks everything is fine and has no clue just how unhappy I am. I know I have faults too but at this point I'm emotionally disconnected and ready to give up. A start to fixing us is so simple....start with 1-10.</p></div></div><hr>

Men are expected to change who they are and be more female because that is the "right" way and the man's way is bad.

I think the author gets way to caught up in gender stereotypes and and can't really conceive of men/women having emotional priorities outside of her labels. Lines like "While you strive to keep your independence, she longs to connect with you." Make it abundantly clear that she thinks men and women are fundamentally different creatures, no-ifs-and-or-buts. I think most of her sweeping generalizations are insulting to BOTH genders. "Her desire is to spend time with you, the man she loves." implies that men do NOT desire to spend time with their spouses. The whole Christmas lights analogy seems incredibly demeaning to women, and the sex stuff (in which you're suppose to lay out a calculated day full of deliberate affectionate in order to get laid that night) seemed pretty insincere, even though it wasn't meant to be.</p><p class="">Bottom line, I would love this article if it took out the gender roles and acknowledged that you and your spouse are emotional different in some ways, similar in others. Then the title could be "Here are some things that may be problematic for you and your spouse if each come at that topic from a different place." (Okay, that's a terrible title but you get the idea)</p></div></div><hr>

Just read the post on what women do to destroy marriage as well as this one and you are spot on with everything. Even though we are all different, a lot of these things seem to be fairly universal and i must say I am extremely blessed to have my husband. Yes he does a few of these. He doesn' t say sorry as much as I would like and sometimes his listening skills aren' t all there but he' s not perfect and neither am i. Open discussion about what we can do better is a necessity in any marriage and when you place blame on your spouse rather than looking at your own actions as well culminates in broken relationships. I believe that the most important goal of marriage is to glorify our heavenly Father through our earthly relationships and that can grate against our very human behaviours. We celebrate 15 years of marriage in January and I think instead of him planning a surprise for us, I will plan it. Thankyou for you post!</p></div></div><hr>

You wrote in suggestion  4 to never say you're sorry,  but then explained that a husband should apologize.  Get on top of your writing.  In #9, you suggest taking responsibility.  I agree,  but this is not solely a husband,  or a wife's job.  This is a grown ass adult's job. finally,  number 10? Really ? Your advice is a passive- aggressive diatribe of men picking the wrong person? Wake up call. .. so do women. Stop trying to create a dichotomy of men v.s. women.  That's known.  Start trying to create a real understanding and bridge the gap.  Writing an article that promotes the "you go girl" or  some  douche  promotion of "bitches ain't shit,  bros before hoes" bullshit just further purposes the bipartisan climate that exists and has apparently always existed.

<div class="comment" id="comment16244797"><div class="author_photo"></div><p class="comment_meta"><strong>Beena&nbsp;</strong><span class='timestamp'>8 months ago   </span></p><div class="comment_body"><p class="">This is so true for so many people. Men today lack commitment and honesty that's required in a relationship. Most of them cheat and invest their energies elsewhere. If they were true and honest with the one relationship that matters the most, they won't face all the issues that surface at very late stages. Women can put all the effort and can live with anything except for men who cheat on them. Some men who cheat blame their wives for the cheating but at the end of the day you do what you want to do. And the only person responsible for cheating is you and no one else. Cheating is easy. Weak men do that. Strong is he who stays loyal to a relationship even when they have chances.</p></div></div><hr>

As far as the comment of me being angry and sad? Not even close. I had a woman that no longer wanted to be married to a family man, working 6.5 days a week to improve our lives and those of our beautiful children. Who destroyed everything. Men are the bad guys? I don't think so. The female of the species is more cunning and conniving. To get what they want - and this method is used EVERY SINGLE DAY -  they'll shorten their skirts and unbutton an extra button on their blouse. Done with this article.</p></div></div><hr>

So, while this list below may seen daunting, always remember that. If life is stressful, then work on changing your perception. You can see peace instead of stress. You are only one thought away from a peaceful life. If you feel unhappy, seek the things that will fulfill you in life. Just be happy. The simplest route to something is to just be. The only person you can change is yourself. Also, while both the husband and wife should take responsibility for their part in a marriage, below are ten mistakes common to men. Read on to learn about the behaviors of men which can completely destroy a marriage. 1. Leaving Her Alone One of the quickest ways to destroy your marriage is to leave your wife alone. This means things like spending long hours at work and following it up by a beer or several afterward with the guys. Then, when you get home, you don't engage her or your children. Instead, you lose yourself in baseball or computer poker. Also, on the weekends, you'll complain about the messy house, then leave to run errands, and then you don't come back for several hours. One of the most most miserable experiences for a wife is that feeling of isolation when her husband emotionally leaves the relationship. Yes, she has friends and a job. Yes, she spends a lot of time running the kids around and partaking in activities outside of her husband. It's not the same. Her desire is to spend time with you, the man she loves. To be left alone by her husband causes deep heartache for women. For most women, their largest fears boil down to isolation and deprivation. When she feels abandoned by you, she attacks with hurtful and disrespectful behavior. Her ability to verbally hurt you is her strongest weapon, and she uses it out of fear in an effort to try to get your attention. When a wife begins to nag because you never spend time at home, never hang out with her, and never engage with the kids, chances are she is feeling abandoned and isolated. When you stop spending time together, the emotional distance between you two grows quickly. Leaving your wife alone or not paying enough attention to her could create more distance than you realize. 2. Not Getting Close Enough Your wife feels energized when she feels close to you. Refusing to let her know you is destructive to her and your marriage. While you strive to keep your independence, she longs to connect with you. It is not fair to either of you if you are only affectionate and attentive on the days you want sex or something from her. Affection and closeness ought to be an end in themselves, not a means to a different end. Talking is not the only way women feel close, although it is an important one. Simple ways to fulfill your wife in this area are to hug her often, hold her hand, and to spend some time alone with her. When her need for closeness is met, she will be more inclined to respect your need for independence. When your wife feels close to you, she will also be more willing to engage with you on a more intimate, sexual level. The important thing to remember is to help her feel connected. Try talking to her about your day, your fears, hopes, and dreams. Hold her hand when you go out together. Kiss her unexpectedly in the kitchen while she makes dinner. Sit next to her. Ask her how she is doing, and for a few minutes, give her your undivided attention while she answers. A little bit will go a long way and mean everything to her and, in turn, your marriage. 2.5. Closing Yourself Off to Her Women exist as an integrated circuit. The mind, body, and soul are closely linked \u2014 so, hurt feelings affect the entire system. A wife whose spirit is crushed may suffer from fatigue and confusion. Like a strand of Christmas lights \u2014 when one light goes out, they all go dark. Men compartmentalize. If one light goes out on his strand, all the other lights function properly, unaffected. Men are able to fully function when one area of their lives is not working properly. Your wife does not understand the closed-off and mysterious way you operate. Things don't seem to bother you. You never want to talk to her. She knows you are stressed about work, yet you don't show it or express that further to her. She wonders how you can even function. Your wife is not trying to pry or sneak her way into no-man's land. She simply wants you to be open. She wants to truly see you. She feels loved when you share your fears, worries, and troubles. She wants to be that person for you and committed to being so when you got married. She won't try to fix you. She will listen. Try talking to her about what is going on in your life. Women like to vent, without seeking a solution, and she wants to give you the freedom to share yourself verbally. Men: don't compartmentalize. Tell your wife what is going on. 3. Always Trying to \"Fix\" Her Even when she doesn't always say it, your wife sees you as her strength. As the bearer of her burdens. When she comes to you for help to lighten the load from the weight of her world, it is a compliment. She knows you can handle it. Rather than trying to resolve and repair every issue, however, try to just listen to her. You might even ask if she needs a solution or just an ear. It will be a relief for both of you when you realize that sometimes you don't have to fix all the problems. Furthermore, when you listen, she will feel like you understand her (even if you don't, which is okay). 4. Never Saying \"I'm Sorry.\" All marriages have conflict. The refusal to apologize is a quick way to destroy yours. While conflict is not a pleasant thing, growth and closeness can increase as conflict is resolved. For your wife, an apology means she has moved forward through the conflict, and she is now seeking peace. Many husbands see apologizing as a sure sign of weakness. They think, \"If I apologize, she won't respect me.\" On the contrary, if you humbly apologize and ask her forgiveness, your wife will be putty in your hands. Your small act of contrition soothes her spirit, and acts as a healing balm over her heart. Furthermore, it shows that you're open and willing to make things work, that you care enough to admit to your faults and move past and through them.

Taking Her Insecurities Too Lightly Your wife knows she is highly committed to you. When she sees you looking at other women, in the mall, on TV, on the computer, and in other places, she fears that you may be unfaithful and at the very least, it may make her uncomfortable and question your attraction to them, especially if she is solely just looking at you. Regardless, she is insecure and needs your reassurance, not any belittling, joking, or teasing. These activities all devalues her feelings, which are real. When you stare at a cute young thing as she saunters by, it may be a reminder to your wife of her many imperfections. She feels insecure because she wants to know that you still love her and you looking at other women may not be so reassuring of that. It's okay for you to look at other women, in fact, it's perfectly natural. The danger is when you are blatant and aggressive, disregarding your wife's feelings and staring in spite of her discomfort. Your wife is motivated by your love and loyalty. She has committed her life to you, and wants to feel secure in the fact that you are equally committed to her. A big symbol of your loyalty to your wife is a wedding ring. For a woman, this is a sign of your fidelity. A married man without a ring seems to be trying to hide something. This requires very little effort, if any, on your part to reassure your wife in this way, and yet it would mean the world to her. Her peace of mind ought to be worth the cost of an inexpensive, outward expression of your fidelity. You have nothing to hide. A ring is a simple, outward expression of your devotion to your wife and to your marriage. This small gesture can have deep impact. When your wife feels insecure, she may ask if you still think she is pretty. She may ask if you love her. She may ask if you think someone else is more attractive. This is not a trap. She feels she is moving toward you, by asking a question and starting a conversation. Talking is how women feel close. She is seeking your assurance of love and loyalty. Rather than make light of the moment, look at her. No, really look at her. Tell her she is the most beautiful woman you have ever seen. Give her the assurance she seeks, and ease her troubled mind. 6. Ignoring the Importance of Simple Gestures Your wife does not require fancy jewelry or expensive meals. Granted, those things are nice, and you like to treat your wife. However, it isn't always necessary. She feels most loved by the small tokens of your love and appreciation. When you neglect the small things, it may feel to her like you are trying to buy her affection \u2014 or ease your own guilt \u2014 with the big things. Let your wife know that she is on your mind during the day. A single rose when you walk in the door speaks volumes to her language of love. Give her a call or send her a text during the day to let her know you are thinking of her. Offer to help with dinner, or wash the dishes. These are small gifts of your time that mean the world to your wife. For your wife, the most important days of the year are her birthday and the day she married you. Celebrate these days by spending time with just her. It will mean more than any expensive gift ever could. The cost of the gift is secondary to the thought you put into it. She wants to feel special and important to you. The way to help her feel loved is to spend time with her alone. Even if you sit home and watch a movie, give her your undivided attention. A simple gesture like a nice cake on your wife's birthday (or any day, if she's a fan of sweets) can do more than you realize. 7. Taking All the Fun Out of Sex When you confuse sex with intimacy, it's no fun. When you only focus on your own orgasm, it's no fun. When you only show interest in your wife when you want to get lucky, it's no fun. When you devalue the depth of your sexual relationship with crude jokes and pornography, it's no fun. When you expect her to get excited instantly, it's no fun. When you neglect your wife's sexual needs, it's no fun. When you are married, sex is supposed to be fun. An intimate sharing, designed to bring you closer, sex should cement the bond between you. For example, think of your wife as a crockpot. Meanwhile, in this comparison, you are a microwave. Put a meal in a microwave, and you are eating within three minutes. A crockpot meal takes a lot of forethought. You need the proper ingredients. You have to put everything together, turn it on, and wait. Six or eight hours later, you enjoy a delicious meal. Your wife needs the same thoughtful consideration. Start in the morning with a kiss. Tell her she's beautiful. Women never get tired of hearing that from the man they love. Help get the kids ready for school. After work, ask about her day. Slow, slow, slow. If you want to bring the fun back into sex, think crockpot, not microwave. You can microwave in the shower (not literally, obviously). 8. Getting Lost in Bitterness and Anger When you shut your wife out to brood in your despair, it fills her with fear. Women like to talk things out. Men like to shut things out. When you feel stressed about work, about money, about your relationship, you turn inward. This provokes your wife's fear of abandonment and rejection. She thinks you don't love her when you refuse to speak. This fear, and her desire to resolve conflict, cause your wife to pursue you. She wants to talk it out, not to belittle or demean you, but to feel closer. She wants you to trust her, so she can trust you. She follows you around, asking if everything is alright. You run away from her and avoid wanting to discuss what is bothering you. She knows something is wrong, and she begins to assume that she is the problem. You can stop this train wreck before it happens by opening up to your wife. She loves you. You can trust her. Share your real feelings with her, and she will open her heart to you. 9. Not Taking Responsibility Whether it's an addiction, an affair or poor performance in your life, many times, husbands point to their wives as the reason for their weakness. \"She makes me drink because of her nagging. I cheated because she wouldn't take care of me. I'm doing poorly because she never encourages me.\" It's time to take full responsibility for your own behavior. You need to take ownership of your actions. You choose to drink. You choose to cheat. You choose to work or not work. You actively do all these things on your own. Rather than blaming someone or something else, stand up and take control. Make your life reflect the values you desire. Your life is completely under your control. Today, you can choose differently. You can create exactly the life you want. Furthermore, if your wife really is the root of all the problems in your life, then take control of that as well and man up and tell her the truth. She can't change if you aren't willing to express the problem. If you have an addiction or problem, don't always blame your wife. 10. Picking the Wrong Woman. Again. A woman in distress, who just moves from crisis to crisis, will continue to be in distress after you marry her. A nitpicking woman who criticizes your every decision will continue to nitpick. A control freak always wants control, even after the wedding. The bottom line is: if she is the wrong woman before the marriage, she'll be the wrong woman when and after you get married. If you want a nice wife, then date a nice woman and marry her. Treat her with love and respect and she will return the kindness. Trying to rescue a woman in distress will only lead you to feel used and unappreciated. A strong marriage begins with a good-willed woman and a good-willed man. It flourishes as you both grow in love and respect toward each other. Choosing the wrong woman sets you up for failure every time. Although you might like the feeling of being a knight in shining armor rescuing a damsel in distress, the reality of being married is much harder and much less idealistic. Marriage takes work, from both the husband and the wife. When both are committed to making the marriage a good experience, then it has a better chance of succeeding. Work on Yourself While this list may seem daunting, it is important to remember that the main goal of marriage should be peace and happiness. If life is stressful, work on changing your perception. You can see peace instead of stress. You are only one thought away from a peaceful life. If you feel unhappy, seek those thing that will fulfill you in life. Just be happy. The simplest route to something is to just be. The only person you can change is yourself.

On our wedding day, when my wife put her ring on my finger, I felt incredibly blessed and proud; and apart from a couple of times when medical procedures have required it, I've worn it every day since. My wife has an interesting view on it. She's always said that, instead of \"sisters doing it for themselves\", too many sisters are doing it TO themselves, and that for some, a man's wedding ring represents both an opportunity (if he can be tempted), and a challenge (if he hasn't yet been). To me, it's always been a badge of fidelity, but I've nevertheless had my share of encounters which add credibility to my wife's observation.

I am not a religious nut, in fact don't even go to church, however it is beautiful in its simplicity.  It holds the man not entitled but responsible for the care of the marriage and the woman.\n\n  I know many many men who \"pick\" the right woman only to treat her so horribly, and become competitive, and out to win by domination, subjugation, over control (while not applying their rules of engagement to themselves), jealousy (of her mother, father, friends, and yep, their children, her hobbies well, you name it) as they have been wrongly told this is how you keep a woman and be a man. \n\n  I have heard men joke, belittle women, objectify them, and brag about their lies to women.  I have seen men put everything and everyone first on their list but the wife and her \"needs\" or those of the family as important at all, and just  assign those things as the wife's responsibility. They joke and laugh and lie their way out of all home-based responsibility.  Who think because they may work outside the home, they are entitled to be free from ANY and ALL responsibilities IN the home. \n\n Then they actually think they can come home and do the right thing by the wife. Or over time they  become obsessed with how \"manly\" they are to keep the little woman in line. \n\n  They  are so egotistical they cannot hear one thing about themselves that isn't totally positive, and they expect those positive strokes while totally downgrading  wife, and her feminine constantly. They rarely, if ever sincerely show any appreciation for the wife, and less, if she doesn't work outside the home. \n\n  These are frequently the same men that blame the failure of the marriage on the woman, and continue to further tell anyone and everyone who they can or will listen to them how the marriage failure was all her fault, and bemoan how SHE got the house, kids and all their money in the divorce.  \n\nOf course, they never realize that HE was rarely IN that house, nor did he take any interest in fixing, maintaining, or putting of his money into the house, and or  rarely spent any time with those CHILDREN, and failed to understand or care how many times he told her it was his MONEY, or how he withheld it from his family to be in control."},{"@type":"Comment","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mitzy"},"datePublished":"2014-02-02T03:52:29-08:00","text":"  I have a husband, who, as we speak is living in his own apartment, with only himself to deal with (well he does have a TV and all his \"awards\") who STILL lectures me about responsibility, and tells ME what to do and how to do it.

I think the author gets way to caught up in gender stereotypes and and can't really conceive of men\/women having emotional priorities outside of her labels. Lines like \"While you strive to keep your independence, she longs to connect with you.\" Make it abundantly clear that she thinks men and women are fundamentally different creatures, no-ifs-and-or-buts. I think most of her sweeping generalizations are insulting to BOTH genders. \"Her desire is to spend time with you, the man she loves.\" implies that men do NOT desire to spend time with their spouses. The whole Christmas lights analogy seems incredibly demeaning to women, and the sex stuff (in which you're suppose to lay out a calculated day full of deliberate affectionate in order to get laid that night) seemed pretty insincere, even though it wasn't meant to be.\n\nBottom line, I would love this article if it took out the gender roles and acknowledged that you and your spouse are emotional different in some ways, similar in others.

He doesn' t say sorry as much as I would like and sometimes his listening skills aren' t all there but he' s not perfect and neither am i. Open discussion about what we can do better is a necessity in any marriage and when you place blame on your spouse rather than looking at your own actions as well culminates in broken relationships. I believe that the most important goal of marriage is to glorify our heavenly Father through our earthly relationships and that can grate against our very human behaviours.

And the only person responsible for cheating is you and no one else. Cheating is easy. Weak men do that. Strong is he who stays loyal to a relationship even when they have chances.

As far as the comment of me being angry and sad? Not even close. I had a woman that no longer wanted to be married to a family man, working 6.5 days a week to improve our lives and those of our beautiful children. Who destroyed everything. Men are the bad guys? I don't think so. The female of the species is more cunning and conniving. To get what they want - and this method is used EVERY SINGLE DAY -  they'll shorten their skirts and unbutton an extra button on their blouse.

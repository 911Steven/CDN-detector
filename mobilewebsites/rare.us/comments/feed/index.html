			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talk about a close encounter! Michael Delaney recently took his GoPro into a den of rattlesnakes in Winnett, Montana and captured all of the slithering details.</p>
<p>Delaney posted the video on his Facebook page commenting that &#8221; [a] Snake strikes GoPro and knocks it into the pit of snakes, I used a hockey stick to fish it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you want to get straight to the camera strike, jump to the 2:02 mark. Watch all the action, if you dare.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=217453&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifteen-year-old Emily Brooke of Florida says that she thinks American Idol host was speaking to her personally when he invited viewers at home to audition for the singing talent show.</p>
<p>When she saw that the show was auditioning in Tennessee, she knew she had to go.</p>
<p>She began playing local shows and saving up all her money to afford the trip to Nashville.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a lot of other teenagers who will whatever it takes to pursue what ever they want to do,&#8221; her mom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just so excited,&#8221; Emily said.</p>
<p>For her audition song, she sang a former American Idol winner&#8217;s song: Carrie Underwood&#8217;s &#8220;Blown Away.&#8221;</p>
<p>She incorporated her guitar for the audition and the judges, including country star Keith Urban, seemed impressed.</p>
<p>Here is Carrie Underwood&#8217;s original version of &#8220;Blown Away&#8221;:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video of a Russian teacher <a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2015/01/229412-99-girl-teaches-a-lesson/">berating a student </a>in front of the entire class only to get kicked in a, well, sensitive area, is going viral.</p>
<p>He was trying to teach her a thing or two about English pronouns in a painfully derisive way. After nearly a minute of it, the girl kicks him and runs out of the room as the teacher doubles over in pain.</p>
<p>It appears that his repeated poking of her in the head was the last straw.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=125047&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday night, Sony Pictures announced that they would not be releasing the Seth Rogen film, &#8220;The Interview,&#8221; on it&#8217;s planned release date of December 25th.</p>
<p>The picture was scrapped after a hacker organization known as Guardian of Peace threatened 9/11 style attacks at cinemas around the country.</p>
<p>Following Sony&#8217;s announcement, actor Rob Lowe, who had recently been in contact with Rogen, compared Sony&#8217;s decision to cater to hackers to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlin&#8217;s appeasement of Nazi Germany during World War Two.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p>Wow. Everyone caved. The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow.</p>
<p>&mdash; Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobLowe/status/545338568512917504">December 17, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p>Saw <a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen">@Sethrogen</a> at JFK. Both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this. Hollywood has done Neville Chamberlain proud today.</p>
<p>&mdash; Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobLowe/status/545341346673086464">December 17, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div>
<p>Lowe then re-tweeted messages from former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.</p>
<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/RobLowe">@RobLowe</a> it wasn&#39;t the hackers who won, it was the terrorists and almost certainly the North Korean dictatorship, this was an act of war</p>
<p>&mdash; Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) <a href="https://twitter.com/newtgingrich/status/545339504803196928">December 17, 2014</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="embed-twitter">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550">
<p>No one should kid themselves. With the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar. This is a very very dangerous precedent.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legalizing recreation marijuana use in Colorado and Washington state has come with the expected public service announcements to warn people about smoking and driving.</p>
<div id="watch-description-text">
<p id="eow-description">&#8220;In March 2014, CDOT launched a series of three PSAs to education the public on marijuana impaired driving. The main message of these PSAs is that if you drive high, you can get a DUI,&#8221; the videos say on their YouTube.</p>
<p>The ads, while mildly appealing, embrace the token &#8220;lazy stoner&#8221; to get their message across. In one of the ads, the man drops everything at the site of food &#8220;munchies,&#8221; and leaves his recently mounted television to fall off the wall.</p>
<p>In reality, marijuana is often used by many professional adults, not only lazy stoners.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Retailer H&amp;M has made one aspect of wedding planning a little easier for brides-to-be. Women will be able to buy a $99 wedding dress online and in stores by the end of March.</p>
<p>The news comes after Millennials admitted struggling to pay for their Pinterest-inspired wedding receptions and all of the frills associated with the big day.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>“Most unmarried Millennials (69%) say they would like to marry, but many, especially those with lower levels of income and education, lack what they deem to be a necessary prerequisite — a solid economic foundation,” reported Pew.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Brides that do not wish to take the $5,000 TLC &#8220;Say Yes to the Dress&#8221; approach to their wedding can breathe a sigh of relief that H&amp;M has come to the rescue with its newest masterpiece.</p>
<p>The dress — a long, narrow style with intricate beading on the neckline — was featured Tuesday on the Today Show. Its inspiration was old Hollywood glamour paired with a modern twist, according to an H&amp;M representative <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/06/hm-wedding-dress_n_4914145.html?utm_hp_ref=weddings&amp;ir=Weddings?utm_hp_ref=weddings&amp;ir=Weddings">Huffington Post</a> spoke with.</p>
<p>According to H&amp;M&#8217;s website, more than 3,500 people said they would &#8220;absolutely&#8221; wear a $99 wedding dress, compared to just over 450 who said &#8220;no way,&#8221; reported <a href="http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2014/03/11/HM-will-debut-an-affordable-bridal-line-later-this-month/1481394565020/#ixzz2vx6giyUZ">UPI</a>.</p>
<p>H&amp;M has focused on providing affordable clothing to its customers since taking the line across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe to North America.</p>
<p>The wedding dress joins four shorter white dresses — priced under $50 — as perfect pieces for events and receptions during the summer months.</p>
<p>This will be the first H&amp;M wedding dress sold in a regular collection, although a wedding gown did appear in the <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1545382/hm-unveils-viktor-rolf-collection.jhtml" target="_hplink">Viktor &amp; Rolf one-time collection</a> back in 2006. The gown was inspired by old Hollywood glamour but has a modern twist, a rep for H&amp;M said. Tell us what you think about the affordable dress in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legislators may pass the Haleigh&#8217;s Hope Act before the session ends next week, improving access to a form of medical marijuana for children like her who suffer from seizure disorders. But Haleigh won&#8217;t be in Georgia for the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haleigh quit breathing six times last night, so we don&#8217;t have time anymore,&#8221; her mother, Janea Cox, told me Wednesday. Mother and daughter left Thursday for Colorado, which already has legalized the cannabis oil that has helped other children reduce the number of debilitating seizures they suffer from as many as hundreds every day to as few as one every few months.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20132014/HB/885">House Bill 885</a> by <a href="http://www.house.ga.gov/Representatives/en-US/member.aspx?Member=185&amp;Session=23">Rep. Allen Peake</a>, R-Macon, would allow medical researchers in Georgia to study the use of cannabis oil in children who suffer from seizure disorders that have proved resistant to conventional medications. A new version of the bill unveiled Wednesday would also protect parents from prosecution for possession of cannabis oil prescribed for their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law is not perfect,&#8221; said Shannon Cloud of Smyrna, whose 8-year-old daughter Alaina has suffered seizures her whole life due to a genetic condition called Dravet syndrome.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean on July 1,&#8221; when the bill, if passed, would take effect, &#8220;our kids are going to be on the medicine, unfortunately. But if anyone has the resources and the effort to go to Colorado and establish residence and get the medicine, they could bring it back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colorado is mentioned often in relation to cannabis oil. Marijuana also notably became legal for recreational use there this year. But the cannabis oil in question isn&#8217;t smoked and doesn&#8217;t contain enough of the chemical THC to get patients high. It wouldn&#8217;t put Georgia on the road to legalized weed any more than the state&#8217;s approval years ago of marijuana for cancer or glaucoma patients did.</p>
<p>In fact, supporters point out, cannabis oil is already legal in 20 states. Thirteen states, including Georgia as well as Alabama, are currently considering legalizing it.</p>
<p>Unless the federal government loosens restrictions on transporting cannabis oil between states that have legalized it, parents would have to risk a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076729/"><strong>&#8220;Smokey and the Bandit&#8221;</strong></a>-like trip from one of those 20 states to Georgia. If they can get it somehow, the latest version of HB 885 would give them immunity from prosecution.</p>
<p>But the bill could also give them other means to get cannabis oil. Research hospitals could apply to run clinical studies using the oil.</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s Healthcare of Atlanta could have a study up and running by year&#8217;s end if it seeks and obtains the necessary approvals, said David Tatum, CHOA&#8217;s vice president for government affairs. Peake said he expects at least one medical college in the state to seek approval for a study as well.</p>
<p>So this is not a matter of false hope for these children and their parents, even if the bill doesn&#8217;t go as far as some parents had hoped.</p>
<p>Lawmakers&#8217; reluctance to go further is in part because research into the use and long-term effects of cannabis oil is mostly anecdotal at this point. But the success it has shown &#8212; along with the fact legal drugs for these seizures can cause liver damage, kidney failure, hyperactivity, depression or other side effects &#8212; makes for a convincing case Georgia should let studies go forward.</p>
<p>That, and the daunting task ahead of those who feel compelled to go wherever they can to get cannabis oil for their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to pick up and move as a family, much less a special-needs family, to another state. And the point is, you shouldn&#8217;t have to,&#8221; said Shannon Cloud&#8217;s husband, Blaine. The cost is not only a financial one: Moving also means leaving behind family-and-friend support networks and the doctors who have seen their children their entire, young lives.</p>
<p>In Haleigh&#8217;s case, that even means leaving her dad behind in Georgia while she and her mom move west. At least until they can get the medicine she needs and &#8212; assuming HB 885 becomes law &#8212; return.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would mean getting our family back together,&#8221; Janea Cox said. Until then, &#8220;he&#8217;ll be in Georgia and we&#8217;ll be in Colorado.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=68763&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those surveyed in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Wednesday say consuming marijuana is better for one&#8217;s overall health than drinking alcohol or eating sugar.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results once again reaffirm that an overwhelming majority of the American public understands that any potential risks associated with the use or abuse of cannabis are relatively minor to those associated with many other legal and regulated substances,&#8221; NORML Deputy Director Paul Armentano said Thursday in a <a href="http://norml.org/news/2014/03/13/poll-americans-view-pot-as-less-harmful-to-health-than-tobacco-alcohol-or-sugar">statement</a>.</p>
<p>NORML promotes the legalization of marijuana for responsible use by adults.</p>
<p>Of the four substances respondents were asked to rank as the most harmful to a person&#8217;s overall health, tobacco took the cake at 49 percent while alcohol and sugar followed at 24 and 15 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>A mere eight percent of those surveyed said marijuana is most harmful to a person&#8217;s overall health (see p. 22 of the survey).</p>
<p>The poll comprises 1,000 interviews of adults nationwide and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.10 percentage points.</p>
<p>&#8220;Criminalizing cannabis and those who consume it responsibly is a disproportionate public policy response to what is, at worst, a public health issue but not a criminal justice concern,&#8221; added Mr. Armentano.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colorado barber shop owner Hugo Corral is taking a stand for individuals and families that frequent his business and do not wish to smell marijuana upon their visit.</p>
<p>Last week Hugo&#8217;s Barber Shop — located 50 miles north of Denver in Greeley — posted a note on its front door that read, &#8220;Please do not come in if you smell like marijuana. There are families with kids who don&#8217;t want to smell it,&#8221; <a href="http://www.greeleytribune.com/news/10505837-113/corral-marijuana-shop-business">reported</a> The Greeley Tribune.</p>
<p>Three months ago, this issue would not have raised many eyebrows but with Colorado legalizing the purchase and possession of recreational marijuana starting January, its prevalence has increased.</p>
<p>The owner has reminded people that his barber shop is a business, &#8220;not your house.&#8221; His wishes stem from complaints he received from parents about the strong smell of pot from customers in the shop.</p>
<p>The response from patrons and nearby businesses have been positive, reported the <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/03/09/greeley-barber-shop-refusing-customers-that-smell-like-pot/">CBS Denver-affiliate</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s a good move,” said appreciative customer Diana Flores.</p>
<p>There has been some backlash to Corral&#8217;s shop, including threats of lawsuits and passersby spitting on his window.</p>
<p>According to a local attorney CBS spoke with, Corral has &#8220;the right to refuse service to someone who has been smoking pot as long as it’s not a Constitutional issue involving a person’s race, religion or gender.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corral took to the store&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/noco.barbershop">Facebook page</a> to explain his thinking (via <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/marijuana_news_colorado_barber.html">The Oregonian</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<div>It&#8217;s simply about setting good examples in today&#8217;s society for children! It&#8217;s not about the harm it does, it&#8217;s simply the respect to those children and families who&#8217;s children don&#8217;t know what it is- and don&#8217;t need to know! I do agree that people who smell like alcohol and cigarette smoke should have the same respect in any business environment. If you choose to smoke at home, in your vehicle, on your property, around your children &amp; family DO IT! To each their own!!</div>
<p>Despite the events surrounding the shop, Corral said business has remained the same and he plans on keeping the policy out of respect for his clients.</p></blockquote><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=68483&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Runners at a San Jose race recently turned the tables on uniformed World War II veteran Joe Bell, who was apparently taken aback by the spontaneous outpouring of gratitude from the people he was cheering for.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Bell, 95, had come out on the drizzly morning to cheer on the runners in the 8-kilometer race from downtown San Jose to Santana Row. The event&#8217;s charity partner is the Pat Tillman Foundation, which funds scholarships for military veterans and their spouses,&#8221; <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_25256221">reported The Mercury News Sunday.</a></p>
<p>Pat Tillman was an NFL-star-turned-soldier who died in 2002 while serving in Afghanistan.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arizona Governor Jan Brewer Wednesday explained why she vetoed legislation that would have given a defense to religious business owners in the state who would rather not be forced to participate in gay-wedding-related celebrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Senate Bill 1062 does not address a specific or present concern related to religious liberty in Arizona,&#8221; Gov. Brewer said during a brief press conference after the veto. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not heard one example in Arizona where business owners&#8217; religious liberty have been violated. The bill was broadly worded and could result in unintended and negative consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor spoke specifically to the bill&#8217;s proponents saying that, while she believes religious liberty is under attack, she thought SB 1062 would have effected more harm than good.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the supporters of this legislation, I want you to know that I understand that long-held norms about marriage and family are being challenged as never before. Our society is undergoing many dramatic changes. However, I sincerely believe that Senate Bill 1062 has the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Cole Galloway has fueled an endeavor that has so far empowered 100 special-needs children by equipping them with their own set of wheels.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to feel like you have control over your own happiness and I know, for children, that&#8217;s attached to your mobility,&#8221; said Dr. Galloway, founder of Go Baby Go, in an interview with <a href="http://www.nationswell.com/">NationSwell</a>.</p>
<p>Go Baby Go is a project at the physical therapy department at the University of Delaware that customizes ride-on cars to meet the unique physical-therapy needs of young children with Down Syndrome, according to the group&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UDGoBabyGo/info">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Delaware professor says the custom rides give the children a more positive outlook and enable them to better engage their peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have lots of kids that aren&#8217;t invited to birthday parties — ever. Friends are hard to make when you&#8217;re not mobile,&#8221; Dr. Galloway said.</p>
<p>He and those at Go Baby Go keep a number of ride-on parts at their fingertips so they are able to make tweaks to the miniature vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We keep a variety of cars so that we can mix and match parts,&#8221; said Dr. Galloway, who has brought smiles to numerous faces thanks to the enterprising program.</p>
<p>&#8220;When he&#8217;s on the bike, he just often just get this really big happy grin on his face,&#8221; said Barbar Ley of her special-needs son Xander, who lights up every time he gets on the ride-on ATV Dr. Galloway made the young boy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A video in which Norwegian researchers mount a hidden camera and watch to see who helps a shivering young boy is going viral.</p>
<p>The approximately two-and-a-half-minute video, posted Wednesday to YouTube, has more than 150,000 hits.</p>
<p>Passersby show concern for the young boy, who says his jacket was stolen, and offer him a range of winter accessories, from gloves and scarves to the jackets off their backs.</p>
<p>The video is meant to raise awareness for homeless children in Syria and prompts people to visit <a href="http://www.sos-barnebyer.no/Mayday/Syria">this</a> website, which solicits donations to benefit the SOS Children&#8217;s Emergency Fund.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani Wednesday criticized President Obama for an unprecedented disinterest in working with members of Congress toward legislative goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I mean, if you think about what the president has done, he&#8217;s basically trying to override the separation of powers because he&#8217;s not happy with the fact that he has to deal with a Congress that&#8217;s actually — well, he&#8217;s got a split Congress. You know, almost every president — with few exceptions — had to deal with that,&#8221; Giuliani said in response to a question from Fox &amp; Friends co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reagan had to deal with that, Clinton had to deal with that, both Bushes had to deal with that. We didn&#8217;t have this kind of problem with them,&#8221; Giuliani said.</p>
<p>President Obama made waves recently after announcing he would go over members of Congress to achieve his political agenda.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 3:46 to watch Giuliani discuss President Obama.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Political heavyweights, including real-estate mogul Donald Trump, Tuesday threw their star power behind former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-Alaska) in a video, titled &#8220;Happy 50th Birthday Governor Palin,&#8221; compiled by those at ShePACTV.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a spectacular woman with a fantastic husband and family; I just want to wish you, really, a happy, happy birthday,&#8221; Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>ShePAC is a political action committee that supports conservative women — especially those candidates that support fiscal restraint; a strong national defense; limited government; Second-Amendment rights; free markets; and human life.</p>
<p>Others joined the chorus of &#8216;happy birthday,&#8217; including former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich; former Florida Rep. Allen West; former running-mate Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.); Duck Commander Phil Robertson; columnist Star Parker; Gov. Jan Brewer (R-Ariz.); Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah); Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) and Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah, you&#8217;ve been a real hero to many Americans. On your birthday, I would urge you to take a few minutes off and realize how many friends you have all across America,&#8221; Mr. Gingrich said.</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had some insight on the milestone birthday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations on finally making it to 50. I&#8217;ve been there a long time; it&#8217;s really OK,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Duck Dynasty&#8217;s Phil Robertson assured the conservative matriarch that 50 looks great on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look a day over 40; don&#8217;t let anybody kid you. God has been good to you, child,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thanks to former Florida Rep. @AllenWest for sharing this story to his Facebook.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker John Boehner announced Tuesday that the House will vote this week to increase in the government&#8217;s borrowing cap without any add-ons demanded by R<span style="color:#000000;">epublicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">This move amounted to a capitulation by Republicans to President Barack Obama and Capitol Hill Democrats who argued that the GOP should not attempt to use the must-pass increase in the so-called debt limit as leverage to extract concessions from the administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Boehner announced the plan after a poll of the Republican rank and file failed to show enough support for a strategy aimed at tying the hike in the debt limit to a plan to reverse a recently passed cut to military pensions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;We&#8217;ll let the Democrats put the votes up. We&#8217;ll put a minimum number of (GOP) votes up to get it passed,&#8221; Boehner said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">The Ohio Republican said he expected virtually all of Obama&#8217;s Democratic allies to vote for the so-called cleandebt cap increase but that he would be one of the few Republicans to also back it in a vote on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Boehner&#8217;s announcement came after a plan hatched on Monday to reverse a recently passed cut to military pensions as the price for increasing the government&#8217;s borrowing cap got a rocky reception from skeptical conservatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Right now we&#8217;ve got a debt ceiling bill that increases spending, which is diametrically 180 degrees opposite of what we were battling over just two years ago — where the question was how much in spending cuts we were going to get,&#8221; said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Now, rather than trying to win over unhappy Republicans for the debt ceiling vote, Boehner will rely on Democrats on Wednesday to pass a &#8220;clean&#8221; increase in the borrowing cap through March of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I would expect virtually every Democrat to vote for it,&#8221; Boehner said, adding that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., promised him sweeping Democratic support.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Tuesday&#8217;s developments amount to a bitter defeat for a party that has sought to use must-pass debt ceilingmeasures as leverage to force spending cuts on Democrats. Republicans won more than $2 trillion in spending cuts in a 2011 showdown, but gave Obama two debt limit increases last year with only modest add-ons.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Time is running out for lawmakers to act to lift the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told lawmakers last week that Treasury will exhaust by Feb. 27 its ability to employ accounting maneuvers to borrow to pay its bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Lew told congressional leaders Monday that he had begun tapping two large government worker retirement funds to clear room under the debt limit. The action involving the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund will provide $50 billion to $75 billion in additional borrowing room, while tapping the Government Securities Investment Fund will provide about $175 billion in borrowing room, Lew estimated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Lew announced he would suspend payments to these two pension funds and would also draw down investments made in the funds. Previous Treasury secretaries have also employed this bookkeeping maneuver. Once Congress approves a new debt ceiling, the Treasury makes the funds whole by replacing the withdrawn funds and lost interest earnings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Lawmakers temporarily suspended the borrowing limit last October in an agreement that ended a government shutdown and extended the federal borrowing limit. With a fresh extension of borrowing authority now needed again, the GOP debt limit plan is likely to employ the same approach and suspend the debt limit through early next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Raising the limit is needed so the government, which ran a $680 billion deficit last year, can borrow enough to pay all its bills, including Social Security benefits, interest payments on the accumulated debt and government salaries. Both Democrats and Republicans agree that failing to do so could spark a disaster in financial markets.</span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=62582&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

"Don't ask, don't tell" applied to everybody.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=62736&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Random thoughts on the passing scene:</p>
<p>It is amazing how many people still fall for the argument that, if life is unfair, the answer is to turn more money and power over to politicians. Since life has always been unfair, for thousands of years and in countries around the world, where does that lead us?</p>
<p>I am so old that I can remember when sex was private. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; applied to everybody.</p>
<p>However fascinated the U.S. Supreme Court may be with the concept of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; every one of the nine justices has a degree from one of the eight Ivy League institutions, out of the thousands of institutions of higher learning in this country. How diverse is that?</p>
<p>Despite the rhetoric, the goals or the intentions of the political left, the world they seek to create is a world where decisions are taken out of the hands of ordinary citizens and transferred to third parties. Obamacare is the latest example of this trend, and can now join the long list of the &#8220;compassionate&#8221; catastrophes of the left.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to see academics full of indignation over the &#8220;exploitation&#8221; of low-wage workers by multinational corporations in third-world countries, when it is common on their own academic campuses to have young men get paid nothing at all for risking their health, and sometimes their lives, playing football that brings in millions of dollars to the college and often gets coaches paid higher salaries than the president of the college or university.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t happen to like the idea of &#8220;stop and frisk.&#8221; However, I like even less the idea of armed hoodlums going around shooting people. Those who refuse to see that everything has a cost should be confronted with the question: &#8220;How many more young blacks are you willing to see shot dead because you don&#8217;t like &#8216;stop and frisk&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you think human beings are always rational, it becomes impossible to explain at least half of history.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks understood that carrying any principle to extremes was dangerous. Yet, thousands of years later, some Western nations take tolerance to the extreme of tolerating intolerance among immigrants to their own societies. Some even make it illegal — a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; — to warn against intolerant foreigners who would like nothing better than to slit the throats of their hosts, but who will settle for planting a few bombs here and there.</p>
<p>How do the clever Beltway Republicans and their consultants explain how Ronald Reagan won two consecutive landslide election victories, doing the opposite of what they say is the only way for Republicans to win elections?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why it bothers me when I see a good-looking woman who could be truly beautiful if she only took the trouble. But I can recall a woman like that who was educated at Berkeley, and who apparently thought attention to her appearance was not hip. Unfortunately, her husband met another woman, who had not gone to Berkeley, and who did not have this inhibition — or many other inhibitions.</p>
<p>With his decision declaring Obamacare constitutional, Chief Justice John Roberts turned what F.A. Hayek called &#8220;The Road to Serfdom&#8221; into a super highway. The government all but owns us now, and can order us to do pretty much whatever it wants us to do.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to read one book that will help explain the international crises of our time should read &#8220;The Gathering Storm&#8221; by Winston Churchill. It is not about the Middle East or even about today. It is about the fatuous and irresponsible foreign policies of the 1930s that led to the most catastrophic war in human history. But you can recognize the same fecklessness today.</p>
<p>In a time of widespread disillusionment with both political parties, someone has noted that the only thing these parties say that is believed by the public are their accusations against each other.</p>
<p>Once, when I was teaching at an institution that bent over backward for foreign students, I was asked in class one day: &#8220;What is your policy toward foreign students?&#8221; My reply was: &#8220;To me, all students are the same. I treat them all the same and hold them all to the same standards.&#8221; The next semester there was an organized boycott of my classes by foreign students. When people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment seems like discrimination.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Rowe of Discovery Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Dirty Jobs&#8221; fame responded on Facebook Monday to public criticism over his narration of a new Walmart commercial advocating a $250 billion campaign to create manufacturing jobs in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night during the Olympics, a commercial started running called “I Am a Factory.” It’s part of a larger campaign sponsored by Walmart, called “Work Is a Beautiful Thing.” The commercial features real people doing real work in real factories all across America. It’s not very glamorous, but it’s honest and authentic, and I was honored to narrate it,&#8221; Rowe posted to his Facebook just after midnight.</p>
<p>The Ford spokesman answered numerous questions posed to him by those supportive and skeptical of the manufacturing campaign.</p>
<p>“Hey, I am on your side here, I want &#8220;made in America&#8221; too but make you’re sure on the side of the WORKER not the corporate greed side ok Mike? Love ya,&#8221; said Rose Marie Bayless.</p>
<p>Rowe responds by saying, &#8220;Love ya back, Rose, but no thanks. You offer up a false and dangerous choice. The world is bigger than “Workers vs. Bosses,” and so is this campaign. Remember, Walmart thrives because a majority of Americans like to shop there. Like Apple, Discovery, Ford, and Facebook, Walmart does not exist for the purpose of employing people. No successful company does. Walmart’s first order of business is to serve their customer. Ultimately, the customer calls the shots. Not management. Not labor. Jobs are just a happy consequence of that success.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hiring was surprisingly weak in January for the second straight month, likely renewing concern that the U.S. economy might be slowing after a stronger finish last year.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=61833&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON — Hiring was surprisingly weak in January for the second straight month, likely renewing concern that the U.S. economy might be slowing after a stronger finish last year.</p>
<div>
<p>The Labor Department says employers added 113,000 jobs, less than the average monthly gain of 194,000 in 2013. This follows December&#8217;s tepid increase of just 75,000. Job gains have averaged only 154,000 the past three months, down from 201,000 in the preceding three months.</p>
<p>Still, more people began looking for work in January, a sign that they were optimistic about finding work. Some of these people found jobs, thereby reducing the unemployment rate to 6.6 percent. That&#8217;s the lowest rate since October 2008.</p>
<p>Cold weather likely held back hiring in December, economists said, but the impact faded in January. Construction firms, which sometimes stop work in bad weather, added 48,000 jobs last month.</p>
<p>The figures follow recent signs of economic weakness in the United States and overseas that have sent stock prices sinking. Upheaval in developing countries has further spooked investors. All the turmoil has renewed doubts about the Federal Reserve&#8217;s next steps.</p>
<p>The anxiety marks a reversal from a few weeks ago, when most analysts were increasingly hopeful about the global economy. U.S. growth came in at a sturdy 3.7 percent annual pace in the second half of last year. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 2013 at a record high. Europe&#8217;s economy was slowly emerging from a long recession. Japan was finally perking up after two decades of stagnation.</p>
<p>But then came December&#8217;s weak jobs total. And on Monday, an industry survey found that manufacturing grew much more slowly in January than in December. A measure of new orders in the report sank to the lowest level in a year. That report contributed to a dizzying 326-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
<p>Also this week, automakers said sales slipped 3 percent in January. And last week, a measure of signed contracts to buy homes fell sharply, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>On a more hopeful note, a survey of service sector companies, including retailers, banks and restaurants, found that they grew faster in January than in December.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s report showed that some higher-paying industries added jobs in January. Factories created 21,000 new positions. Professional and technical services, which includes architects and engineers, added 20,000.</p>
<p>But health care employment was mostly unchanged for a second straight month, after adding 17,000 jobs a month last year. And retailers cut 12,900 jobs, the most in 18 months.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In America, we are “innocent until proven guilty.”</p>
<p>In Massachusetts? Not so much.</p>
<p>It’s been more than a year since the Newtown tragedy, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed twenty children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.</p>
<p>This week, a panel of “academic experts” recommended 44 new gun-law restrictions for Massachusetts, even though the commonwealth’s gun laws are already some of our nation’s most restrictive. According to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/02/03/panel-recommends-that-mass-tighten-gun-laws/oBBQzr1C9FcKDm5v0bLOnM/story.html">Boston.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The panel made 44 recommendations, including that Massachusetts join a national mental health database for screening potential gun owners, that it beef up firearms training requirements, and that it eliminate Class B gun licenses, which are seldom used.</p>
<p>It recommended that the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association help define a series of factors that could be used to prohibit “unsuitable persons” from acquiring firearms. The panel said the current process allows local law enforcement officials too much discretion to determine whether a person is suitable to be granted a license to carry.</p>
<p>It also said Massachusetts should require anyone wanting to purchase a hunting rifle or a shotgun to pass those standards of suitability. That could allow local police chiefs to deny gun purchases to people who have been arrested, but not convicted, of a crime.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, “innocent until proven guilty” has now become “guilty if questioned and even proven innocent” in the commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Charles C. W. Cooke <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/370251/massachusetts-considers-denying-constitutional-rights-innocent-arrestees-charles-c-w">writes on National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s just repeat that, for clarity’s sake: Massachusetts is considering denying “gun purchases to people who have been arrested, but not convicted, of a crime.” In other words, an American state is thinking about denying a constitutional right to the innocent because they happen to have been picked up by authorities that couldn’t prove that they had done anything wrong. I hope I speak for everybody here when I say, No, no, and no again. No to the abject hysteria that has slowly grown in small parts of the country; no to the ignorance that is burning like acid through reason and through the law; and no to a cabal of politicians whose disdain for the Second Amendment is so pronounced that they are happy not only to undermine that provision in pursuit of their quixotic goals but to dilute the rest of the American settlement into the bargain. Enough is enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, he asks an interesting question.  “Where art thou, ACLU?”</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union calls itself “our nation&#8217;s guardian of liberty, working daily in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country.”</p>
<p>What rights, you might ask?</p>
<p>Well, their website says they will activate if “your right to due process — fair treatment by the government whenever the loss of your liberty or property is at stake.”</p>
<p>Well, here’s a clear-cut example as Massachusetts considers stripping the Constitutional rights of people who have been arrested — but not convicted — of a crime.</p>
<p>Though their website says they are non-partisan, the ACLU says they defend “people of color; women; lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people; prisoners; and people with disabilities.” I wonder what they’ll say about people who aren’t even prisoners who have lost their constitutional rights?</p>
<p>I suspect I know the ACLU will remain silent. The left likes to pretend the Second Amendment doesn’t exist and, while it busies itself with inventing rights (like the deadly “right” to abortion), it ignores the plain words on the constitutional page.</p>
<p>In other words, ideology trumps liberty, and the law-abiding citizens of Massachusetts pay the price.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=61180&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wis.) Monday on Fox &amp; Friends laid out the reasons Wisconsin&#8217;s economy has done an about-face in the last three years — an about-face that has precipitated a near $1 billion surplus for those in the badger state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for us it was simple,&#8221; Gov. Walker told Fox &amp; Friends co-anchor Steve Doocy. &#8220;We put in place commonsense reforms that allowed the economy to get better — about a billion-and-a-half-dollars worth of tax relief for the last three years but also reigning in frivolous and out-of-control lawsuits and excessive regulations and other things that stood in the way of employers creating more jobs in our state,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The governor said those in Wisconsin are not objecting to the state&#8217;s decision to hand that surplus right back to the taxpayers that generated the revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I said, &#8216;When I go around the state of Wisconsin, even on cold days like today, I got to tell you, I don&#8217;t hear anybody tell me &#8216;We want more of our money to stay in Madison, our state capitol.&#8217; In fact, I don&#8217;t hear people say taxes are too low or even just right. You know, they say &#8216;If you want to continue the recovery, put more money back in the hands of the hardworking taxpayers.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Some solutions Gov. Walker has proposed for an even<em> more</em> solvent Wisconsin are reduced property taxes; reduced income taxes; and reduced withholding taxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve found is, it took tough decision — tough, bold decisions — but they paid off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The economy is better, the budget is balanced. We&#8217;ve got a pension that&#8217;s the only one fully funded in America. Our pension-debt ratio per capita is one of the best in the country and we&#8217;ve been able to generate a surplus because our economy is working — because our budget measures are working and we want to keep it rolling,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want more people to grow and we want more people to come to Wisconsin.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Republican National Committee Monday launched a two-fold digital campaign via Spanish television channel Univision.</p>
<p>“This unique opportunity allows us to connect and listen to the concerns of Hispanic who have been hurt by Obamacare,” RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a press release.</p>
<p>Through digital ads on univision.com and 30-second audio ads on Univision’s music radio app Uforia in the Miami media marketplace, Spanish-speaking citizens will be better informed about the shortcomings surrounding Obamacare.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the program is to draw listeners online to share their stories about losing health-care insurance despite President Obama’s promise that Americans would be able to keep their plans.</p>
<p>Univision’s Jorge Ramos lent his voice to the RNC in the ads as he urged listeners to rally together.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=56466&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s no mystery what the left intends to make its next life-or-death issue: income inequality. Liberals are all popping off about it. It&#8217;s everywhere, from Obama&#8217;s speeches to liberal think-tanks to liberal reporters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost as if they were conspiring to distract us from Obamacare. Nah!</p>
<p>On &#8220;Meet the Press,&#8221; PBS anchorwoman Judy Woodruff sounded the alarm, not as a dispassionate reporter but as a progressive advocate. While acknowledging Obama&#8217;s problems with Obamacare, she breathlessly insisted, &#8220;At the same time, the argument for doing something about the economy, the argument for addressing inequality, is such a compelling argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behold the liberal mindset. It&#8217;s apparently only of passing concern to Woodruff that Obamacare caused cancellations of millions of policies of insurance for people. That is so last year.</p>
<p>The important thing is that liberal icon Barack Obama forced quasi-socialized healthcare through Congress, and any harm it causes people must take a back seat to advancement of the progressive agenda, which is ostensibly designed (in the progressives&#8217; minds) to prevent harm to people. Ignore the foolish inconsistency. Nor does it matter that Obama lied about the harm his sacred plan would cause. The progressive agenda is marching forward.</p>
<p>Liberals must now shift our attention to the next issue they can preen about and showcase their moral superiority.</p>
<p>Notice that Woodward didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;We need to get the economy moving again and get people back to work.&#8221; She conflated &#8220;doing something about the economy&#8221; with &#8220;the argument for addressing inequality.&#8221;</p>
<p>News flash: You don&#8217;t do something about the economy by obsessing over income redistribution. The two are connected, but not in the sense liberals believe they are.</p>
<p>While Obama liberals scoff at conservatives for their alleged &#8220;trickle-down&#8221; approach to economics, they make the preposterous counterargument that you grow the economy &#8220;from the middle out,&#8221; by which they mean you fuel economic growth by redistributing income.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t generate economic activity by punishing producers and taking their earnings and giving the money to others. How in the world could that expand the economic pie?</p>
<p>More likely, as history demonstrates, it will shrink the pie by disincentivizing all groups from producing. The wealthy will produce less because, when you increase taxes on something (in this case, productivity and success), you get less of it. The recipients will mostly produce less because they are rewarded for not producing.</p>
<p>So, &#8220;addressing inequality&#8221; is connected to &#8220;doing something about the economy&#8221; but in precisely the opposite way the left implies. Efforts to misuse the tax code to equalize outcomes — as opposed to using it for the purpose of securing funds for constitutionally prescribed federal-government functions — will usually harm the economy.</p>
<p>Some liberals probably don&#8217;t even believe their own propaganda that redistribution stimulates economic growth. In 2008, Obama told ABC&#8217;s Charlie Gibson he favors increasing capital gains tax rates despite the fact that such increases had resulted in less revenue for the government. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of fairness, Charlie.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Obama, it was more important to punish the &#8220;rich&#8221; than to help the poor. That&#8217;s his mindset — and it&#8217;s warped.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Obama and his fellow leftists are fixated on redistributing wealth, but a major component of that, as witnessed by his attitude on increasing the capital gains rate, is that the wealthy need to be punished — even if it means hurting lower-income groups.</p>
<p>The irony of all this is that these liberal policies often result in exacerbating income inequality. Obama can pretend, once again, that he&#8217;s an innocent bystander, but income inequality is getting worse under his presidency.</p>
<p>A half-century and trillions of dollars in government transfer payments have not helped the poor. Even <em>The New York Times</em> is grudgingly conceding that after 50 years, &#8220;the war on poverty declared 50 years ago by President Lyndon B. Johnson has largely failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether liberals are able to process the reality that their programs have failed, they will not abandon them, because class warfare and government dependency programs are their ticket to power. CNN&#8217;s Candy Crowley unwittingly admitted as much when she asked Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker why any unemployed American or minimum-wage worker would become a Republican.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that conservatives don&#8217;t care about the poor. It&#8217;s that we do care about the poor — and everyone else. We believe that our free-market solutions generate economic growth, stimulate upward mobility and improve the economic lives of far more people, including the poor and middle class, than any other system. History vindicates us.</p>
<p>The left will always win the &#8220;look at how much I care about you&#8221; contest. But it loses in the &#8220;actually caring&#8221; department because, at some point, people have to be presumed to have intended the damaging results their policies have consistently caused.</p>
<p>Liberals can posture about how much they care and they can try desperately to change the channel from Obamacare, but the devastating harm that program has caused to millions already may finally have punctured their pretense of caring and their shameless practice of attempting to exempt themselves from accountability for their policies.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miley Cyrus has made her mark on the Oxford dictionary in an entry that&#8217;s sure to make scholars cringe, but her &#8216;twerking&#8217; was the more minor of her on-air exploits.</p>
<p>A couple of the more inappropriate moments of Miley&#8217;s performance are the shots in which she slaps the posterior of one of the teddy-bear entertainers, sexual harassment in workplaces other than MTV, and puts a Miley spin on the foam finger. You know the one I&#8217;m talking about — the scene where the foam finger is used to cheer but not in the traditional sense of the game-day icon.</p>
<p>In one fell thrust, Miley showed there is no &#8220;battle of the sexes&#8221; in mainstream culture but loud, proud full-service peginas. (Miley created more than one word Sunday night.)</p>
<p>Cyrus&#8217; confused sexuality, along with other social cues — e.g., progressive ideas of marriage, government-funded abortion and government-funded contraception — all send the message that there is a social virtue and freedom in childlessness. That is what makes Miley&#8217;s performance not astonishing but tragic, as it reveals the all-too painful truth about contemporary culture: Diversity among the sexes is no longer a treasured good. Oh, no — as a woman, deny your baby-maker and you are &#8220;in.&#8221;</p>
<p>This messaging is especially disconcerting because, <a href="http://rare.us/story/stossel-battle-of-the-sexes/">as best-selling author John Stossel points out in a recent column</a>, the qualities that make women excellent caregivers are inherent to their womanhood, and also make them excellent candidates for corporate leadership.</p>
<p>Interested in seeing some real dancing instead of a contemporary Lady Macbeth? If so, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU1_OssfgR4">watch Kelly Pickler&#8217;s &#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221; swan-song performance</a> — or, if you want to see something truly sexy but not necessarily dance-related, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtJEyXOoMi8">watch 2002 Olympic champions Jamie Sale and David Pelletier weave a gripping narrative in their on-ice interpretation of &#8220;Love Story.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Those are the tales that deserve air time. And thank goodness Miley didn&#8217;t get the gold.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashton Kutcher in a moment of candor Sunday night at the 2013 Teen Choice Awards revealed to the audience his success as an actor is largely influenced by who he is underneath his celebrity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like a fraud,&#8221; Kutcher said, as he began his acceptance speech for the Teen Choice&#8217;s &#8220;Ultimate Choice Award.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is actually not even Ashton. Ashton is my middle name; my first name is Chris and it always has been,&#8221; he said, adding he started using his middle when his acting career took off at the age of 19.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are some really amazing things that I learned when I was Chris, and I wanted to share those things with you guys because I think it&#8217;s helped me be here today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Dude, Where&#8217;s My Car?&#8221; actor said the three things that bolstered his rise to stardom are &#8220;opportunity,&#8221; &#8220;being sexy&#8221; and &#8220;living life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that &#8216;opportunity&#8217; looks a lot like hard work,&#8221; he said, recounting his humble beginnings, first hauling shingles for his dad and then as a dishwasher.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had a job in my life that I was better than,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was always just lucky to have a job, and every job I had was a stepping stone to my next job. And I never quit my job until I had my next job.</p>
<p>And so opportunities look a lot like work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being &#8220;sexy,&#8221; he said, means being &#8220;really smart,&#8221; &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; and &#8220;generous,&#8221; he said amid applause.</p>
<p>Everything else in life is peripheral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be smart, be thoughtful and be generous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third thing, said Kutcher, is something he relearned while filming his upcoming movie about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can build your own thing; you can build your own life that other people can live in,&#8221; Kutcher said. &#8220;So, build a life; don&#8217;t live one,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find your opportunities and always be &#8216;sexy.'&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=rare.us&#038;blog=46934866&#038;post=28405&#038;subd=coxrare&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Christian homeschooling family is facing possible deportation to their German homeland because they refuse to send their children to public school, <a href="http://christiannews.net/2013/07/21/christian-homeschooling-family-fighting-deportation-to-appeal-to-u-s-supreme-court/">reports Christian News Network</a>.</p>
<p>The family — comprising Ewe and Hannelore Romeike and their six children — fled to the U.S. in 2008 when German authorities ordered them to stop homeschooling, per German law enacted while Adolph Hitler was dictator.</p>
<p>Memphis immigration judge Lawrence Burman in 2008 granted the family asylum because he believed the family would face religious persecution if they returned to Germany.</p>
<p>Judge Burman’s decision, however, was recently overturned on appeal to the Sixth Circuit by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Court documents submitted in June by the Obama administration assert German law enforcement doesn’t single out certain truants based on religious convictions.</p>
<p>“The panel carefully discussed the Board [of Immigration Appeal]‘s findings and determined that record evidence supports its conclusion that Germany does not selectively enforce its statute against homeschoolers like Romeike nor does it punish them for violating the statute in greater measure than others who do not comply with the statute,” states the response to the Romeike’s petition for rehearing en banc.</p>
<p>The documents further state integration of so-called “minorities” into German education is a “justified interest” as “Dialogue with such minorities is an enrichment for an open pluralistic society.”</p>
<p>Attorney Mike Farris, founder and chairman of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, says he is determined to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“This is not over yet,” he said in a news release. “We are taking this case to the Supreme Court because we firmly believe that this family deserves the freedom that this country was founded on.</p>
<p>Despite [the court&#8217;s] order, the Sixth Circuit’s opinion contains two clear errors: First, they wholly ignored Germany’s proclamation that a central reason for banning homeschooling is to suppress religious minorities.

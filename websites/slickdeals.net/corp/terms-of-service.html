<h2>Slickdeals Terms of Service</h2>
<p>Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully before using our website, www.Slickdeals.net (the “Site”).&nbsp; These Terms govern your use of the Site, and are a legally enforceable contract between Slickdeals LLC (“Slickdeals” or “we”) and you. &nbsp;If you don’t agree with these Terms, please do not use the Site.</p>
<p>We may make changes to these Terms at any time by posting them to the Site.&nbsp; Any changes will be effective at the time of posting.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Accounts</strong></p>
<p>In order to use certain services on the Site, you will need to create an account.&nbsp; All the information you provide when you create your account must be true, accurate, current and complete.&nbsp; You are responsible for all activity in your account, so please secure and protect your login information and password.</p>
<p><strong>Offers</strong></p>
<p>You will find third party coupons, deals, advertisements and other offers on the Site (“Offers”). Offers are for products and services provided by third parties (each, a “Seller”), and if you choose to accept an Offer, the transaction will be between you and the Seller. &nbsp;Slickdeals has affiliate relationships with certain Sellers, and may receive compensation for your purchase from these Sellers. &nbsp;Slickdeals is not a party to, or in any way responsible for, your transaction with a Seller, including when we have an affiliate relationship with Seller.&nbsp; We are not responsible fulfilling any Offers.</p>
<p>Before you purchase a product or service or otherwise accept an Offer, please read the entire description of the Offer, including the fine print and any additional terms and conditions set forth on the Seller’s website.&nbsp; You are responsible for understanding what you are buying and for following the Seller’s instructions.&nbsp; The terms and conditions of Offers, including refund and cancellation policies, are governed by the Seller’s policies, not ours.&nbsp; Please contact the Seller directly for questions regarding the Offer or your transaction with Seller.</p>
<p><strong>Your Content</strong></p>
<p>You may post content, including photos, comments, links, and other materials on the Site, including Offers. Anything that you post or otherwise make available on the Site is referred to as “User Content.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>When you post User Content, you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to do so, including but not limited to having sufficient intellectual property rights in the User Content, and that to the best of your knowledge, the User Content complies with all applicable laws</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from the limited license described below, you retain all rights in the User Content. &nbsp;You grant Slickdeals, its affiliates and its users a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, store, display, reproduce, publish, transmit, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute your User Content on the Site, any other Slickdeals websites and applications, and on third party sites (e.g., under our account with a social networking site). Nothing in these Terms shall restrict other legal rights Slickdeals may have to User Content. &nbsp;We are not obligated to review or monitor User Content but we reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.</p>
<p>We do not guarantee how quickly your User Content will appear on the Site or how and where it will appear. We reserve the exclusive right to describe, categorize and place Offers in our sole discretion.</p>

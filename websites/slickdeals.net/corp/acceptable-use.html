</ol>

<li>No pics of (or suggestive of) sexual acts, including sexually suggestive kissing.<span> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Manufactured Vote Policy:</b></p>
<p>Manufactured votes are against the rules and are defined as any vote made that is not made in good faith based upon the merit of the deal. Examples of manufactured votes include, but are not limited to solicited, automated, fraudulent or retaliatory votes. Deal Editors may decide not to Frontpage a deal if they suspect a deal of having manufactured votes.</p>
<p>Repeat abuse could result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspension of the original poster's account.</li>
<li>Suspension of the ability of those involved in voting for that original poster.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Additional Acceptable Use Guidelines:</b></p>
<p>You acknowledge that Slickdeals may or may not pre-screen Content, but that Slickdeals and its moderators shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, delete, or move any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Slickdeals and its moderators shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable at their sole discretion. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Slickdeals or submitted to Slickdeals, including without limitation information in all parts of the Service., which includes forum board posts.</p>
<p>You acknowledge, consent and agree that Slickdeals may access, preserve and disclose your account information, including your ISP address, and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Slickdeals, its users and the public.</p>
<p>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.</p>
<p>You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by Slickdeals and/or content providers who provide content to the Service. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service.</p>
<p>Membership, use and permissions on this site are at the sole discretion of the site owner. Slickdeals reserve the right to remove, edit, move or close any thread or account for any reason. Some, any or all permissions to view and/or use this site are subject to change, for no reason and no advance notice.</p>
<p>By accessing and using this site/forum, you warrant that you will not post any messages that are obscene, vulgar, sexually-orientated, hateful, threatening, violate any of the listed additional rules, or otherwise violative of any laws. In addition, you also warrant that you will not hold SlickDeals.net Forums or any of its subsidiaries responsible for any post, image, or link posted from a forum member as the moderators cannot catch everything at the instance it happens.</p>
<p>Although the administrators and moderators of SlickDeals.net Forums will attempt to keep all objectionable messages off this forum, it is impossible for us to review all messages. All messages express the views of the author, and neither the owners of SlickDeals.net Forums, nor Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. (developers of vBulletin) will be held responsible for the content of any message.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online — for example, via message boards or chat — that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know. While SlickDeals.net strives to protect your personal information and privacy, Slickdeals cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online; you make such disclosures at your own risk. However, if you violate the rules, SlickDeals.net Forums reserves the right to disclose any and all user activity to the public, third parties and or law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The rules that we have put in place are guidelines that our team uses to ensure that our website remains orderly. It is impossible for us to write a rule for every conceivable circumstance and situation. Thus the “rules” are guidelines: our moderators will look at every situation individually and try to apply those guidelines and look at the “spirit” and intent of the rule. If it is not cut and dry, they will do their best to make a judgement call.
